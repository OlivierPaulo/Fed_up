306785,483827,5,1,Being a  huge fan of America's Test Kitchen  I just had  to try this and I am  sure glad I did. It is really good. Sweet  corn is  just  coming in season here  and I have  chives in my herb garden so I had all the  best ingredients. I did  use a Jalapeno from the  garden instead of the  habanero. I  just made this and I plan to have it with some chicken. I'll  bet you could use some nice peaches to change it up a bit.      Thanks for posting .,2008-07-15
241799,1170714,5,1,This is excellent.  I cut the recipe in half and still had more than enough for what I needed.  I also used more powdered sugar than called for because I wanted a thick filling that wouldn't bulge between the layers.  I could eat it with a spoon it's soooo good!,2011-06-20
241799,1333844,5,1,"I tried this filling and it was really good. I made a 1/4 sized recipe to try it and it was a lot, but was it good!? I followed it to the T and it turned out great. Will post pics soon.",2012-02-26
175042,145352,5,1,Great! Exactly what I had in mind!,2011-10-02
175042,89831,5,1,"This is a wonderful rice recipe! I doubled the ingredients, chopped the onion and increased the garlic to 2 heaping tablespoonfuls, I also added in some toasted almonds and lots of freshly ground black pepper, thanks for sharing this recipe akgrown, we loved it!...Kitten:)",2006-07-04
175042,176615,5,1,"Great quick side dish with lots of flavor! Really kicks up the flavor of brown rice. I served this with baked chicken and a salad for a simple but wonderful meal. Used a Vidalia onion and because I really let it carmelize in the saute pan, probably could have done without the brown sugar. Would suggest using a bit of the broth to deglaze the saute pan so that all of the yummy bits aren't lost, and of course, homemade chicken stock. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!",2006-07-15
175042,334558,5,1,It was a wonderful rice recipe!! I did add an extra clove of garlic! We had this with baked mushroom chicken and a light salad. From now on Im making my rice like this!!!!,2006-07-18
175042,141293,5,1,This was delicious!  Loved the combination of sweet caramelized onion and nutty brown rice.  Will definately make again and again.,2006-07-23
175042,322548,5,1,"Wow! I loved this I made one batch and then another...
usually I'm a brown rice lover but I used white basmati in this to use some up and it was wonderful but brown rice works better. The only other change I made was veg stock for the chicken cause I don't like the dead things. This went really well with mommymakes's spinach balls heaven! ",2006-10-10
175042,230331,5,1,I have never been a big fan of brown rice but this recipe changed my mind.  My husband thought it was okay and he would eat it again.  This is a big step because if it's not rice-a-roni it's not good.  I did use brown basmati rice because I had that to use up and I did it on the stove b/c I have no rice cooker.  Wonderful!,2006-10-21
175042,189616,3,0,"I rarely make brown rice, but the recipe sounded delicious. I'm sure this recipe is fantastic if you like brown rice, so this review is based on our personal taste. I found it okay-too sweet and nutty. My DH no comment-just o.k., my youngest normally a rice lover-it's alright, kind of chewy though my eldest DS-it tastes like crayons (?)he is 13 yrs. old. If I used white rice I'm sure everyone would like it more. I cooked this in the microwave since I don't have a rice cooker.
I served this with recipe#77758 and recipe#67615",2007-07-30
175042,191533,5,1,"I thought this was a delicious way to make brown rice a little special. I halved the recipe for two of us, but used 1 1/2 cups broth. I omitted the sugar; I think caramelized onions have their own sweetness.",2009-08-13
175042,1802198,5,1,My fiance and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!! We first tried it a little less than a month ago and have made it 3 or 4 times. It is the best rice recipe ever.,2011-01-21
175042,2590005,5,1,"Found this recipe on one of those websites where you search for recipes based on the ingredients you already have in your fridge. I just wanted something cheap and easy to make, but this was so, so, so much better than I thought it was going to be, and super cheap. (Like I said, I just made this with things I needed to clean out of my fridge.) If you have a rice cooker, you really need to make this like now. I didn&#039;t use butter, and the chicken broth could easily be substituted with veggie broth, so I think it can be both vegan and gluten free. This would make a fantastic side dish but my boyfriend ate this as a light dinner and were fine, although we did add a little bit of chicken and some mushrooms that needed cooking. Honestly, though, this really doesn&#039;t need anything else, although I think this recipe would do well with some experimentation. Maybe we&#039;ll serve with some broccoli or asparagus on the side next time. Like a previous reviewer, I really caramelized my onions, and they were sweet and brown and flavorful, but I still think that the brown sugar really sent this over the top. Omit the added sugar if it&#039;s really that important to you. Just make sure that you do caramelize your onions--the extra time and effort makes a world of difference. &lt;br/&gt;Seriously. Make. This.",2013-07-07

190594,187281,4,1,"A nice dish that was easy to put together.  I didn't change anything and have to say a few spices would have added something to this dish.  But my husband said he adored it and plans on having it for lunch tomorrow.  So, we give four stars.",2006-10-20
190594,549669,2,0,"I was looking for ways to use up the many many green beans that I have been finding in my CSA box and thought this recipe would accomplish that quickly if I doubled it.  So I did.  It turned out ok.  I used green bell peppers which kind of took over the dish.  I also used 14oz cans of Amy's Mushroom soup and the mixture was very liquidy before I baked it, but turned out to be a fine consistency when it came out of the oven.  I used whole wheat noodles and undercooked them by 3 minutes, but they still turned out mushy.",2007-07-31
190594,83093,5,1,"I loved this simple comfort dish!  Using whole wheat noodles and subbing sugar snap peas for the green beans, it went together quickly and filled up my dieter's plate without any guilt. I used 1 can of tuna for half the recipe and it served 2 perfectly. It baked up fast - 10 minutes and the topping was brown. Thanks for sharing this winner!",2007-11-08
190594,593159,5,1,"Great!  I might use canned green beans next time though.  We liked this alot!  I left out the peppers, and used cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom soup.",2007-11-30
459648,2000552348,5,1,I&#039;ve tried several recipes with baby cereal and this one is th best so far. It actually looks and tastes like pancakes. I used vanilla soy milk for the liquid. My little one loved it! I freeze them and I can give home pancakes every day!,2015-10-12
459648,2001323847,4,1,I used baby oatmeal so I had to add about another forth of a cup or so of milk. My Lil ate it,2016-12-27

350162,277925,3,0,"good basic chili recipe and not to spicy for kids. I made as instructed but used 6 teaspoons od chili powder. The garbonzo beans add a great texture to the dish. If I don't make this again, I will add the Gaarbonzos to my regular chili",2009-01-19

135470,25792,5,1,I didnt change anything on the recipe but to used dried tarragon instead of the fresh.  These were very rich and flavorful mashed potatoes.  The buttermilk and fresh spices really enhanced them.  Thanks Marcie for a recipe that we all loved!,2006-08-23
135470,80353,4,1,"Very, very good.  Loved the buttermilk addition and the fact that I didn't need to use a load of butter.  The minced herbs were delicious in this and we happily scarfed this down with pork chops.",2006-09-05
135470,296809,4,1,"I really enjoy recipes like this, versatile ones that take you where you lead them. These potatoes were served with recipe #159214, so I took them to the SW. I subbed cilantro for the tarragon & parsley + added garlic & a few drops of Tobasco for a bit of a heat level. Like Ev, I liked that they were not loaded w/butter & got their creamy flavor from the combo of buttermilk & seasonings. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us.",2006-11-19
135470,482933,5,1,"Oh my these were fabulous!  Had them with barbecued ribs, steamed broccoli, salad, and pineapple sherbert.  They are perfect!  Thanks for sharing a keeper.  Tomorrow we are having the leftovers in a breakfast casserole and looking forward to it.",2008-05-10
135470,242766,5,1,"Delicious! These potatoes were a wonderful change from standard mashed potatoes.  The buttermilk gave the potatoes a creamy texture and added a sour cream-like tang.  We really loved the flavor the fresh herbs added. I used 8 large red potatoes (unpeeled) instead of the yukon gold. Also, I added 6 cloves of garlic to the potatoes while they cooked.  Thank you for sharing!",2008-07-26
135470,133174,5,1,"Really delicious and creamy.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes along with dried herbs.  I loved the rich taste that the buttermilk provided without a lot of added fat.  This was served with fried chicken, peas and sourdough biscuits for a delicious  Easter feast.",2010-04-04
135470,242584,5,1,"Wonderful recipe, I always make these potatoes when I make recipe 132130 Easy Low Fat Chicken Souvlaki due to the fact I only have buttermilk on hand for this chicken. Fantastic flavors that my family always looks forward to. Thank you so much Parsley for this keeper!",2011-07-05

62125,217360,4,1,This is very tasty. I had to substitute orange juice for the lemon (my lemon was very much past its best). Wasn't entirely sure what to expect and felt dubious about the amount of custard until I saw the gingerbread puff up and make the area to be filled with custard much smaller.,2007-04-04
62125,735593,1,0,We didn't really care for this unfortunately.  And I was very confused about the flan part? I love flan and this didn't resemble flan at all...,2009-10-08

384436,844554,4,1,"I needed to use up some red potatoes and went looking through my recipes to try and this easy one popped out at me. I like the fact there is no mayo. I followed the recipe exactly except I cut it in half. The only thing is I don't know why there's 1 tbsp of olive oil plus the 1/2 cup of olive oil. It didn't matter to me because I just used 1/4 cup. Just curious, though. Going in the keeper file. Thanks.",2009-09-21

345877,4470,5,1,"Wonderful easy recipe packed with flavor - I love Old Bay spice and this combination of lemon, garlic & wine is so tasty - It adds to the flavor - it does not overpower the prawns.  I used Marsala wine in place of sherry6 Dec 09  Made again and enjoyed as much as last time",2009-12-07
93956,39835,4,1,"Very good dish with very little work which we served with (frozen) mixed vegetables. I think I cut my apples too thin because they disintegrated in the casserole and became more like applesauce but we still enjoyed this dish. We also only used 4 pork chops, 2 apples and 2 sweet potatoes but the amount specified for the apple cider and sugar. Next time if I only use 4 pork chops I will cut the apple cider down a bit more (maybe to 1/3 cup). Thanks for sharing!",2006-11-27
93956,380547,2,0,"Like the previous review the apples fell aprt but still tasted good. The brown sugar sauce ended up on the bottom. I thought it would form a type of glaze over the meat but it didn't. I followed the directions except I used apple juice in place of cider. Having said that, the chops were okay. Just not worth all the effort and time it took to cook.",2007-02-02

I made a small batch since I only needed enough to make a ribbon in some sherbet I was churning, but I had quite a few tastes on a spoon and dabbed on toast.  Perfectly sweet-tart, and the vanilla was unexpectedly good with the cranberries.  A definite keeper.  Thanks.",2010-05-29

453484,176706,5,1,Delicious!  I didn't know what size pan to use so I ended up using a 9x13 cake pan.  I doubled the recipe (actually used 8 cups of apples) and its really delicious.  If I change anything it will be less sugar in the topping (I think 1/2 cup would do it) and I might add pecans.  Thank you for the lovely crumble :),2011-05-24
174179,470351,5,1,"We LOVED this!  I wish I had the perfect timing for cooking pork chops since I always seem to overcook them, however, this sauce was super amazing!

First I prepared the meat in batches.  I don't have a large enough bowl to mix 9 lbs of meat at once.  I added 1/4 tsp of ginger to each 2 lb batch.

Mixed with the handle from my wooden spoon and it foamed a little but not near as much as it would if shaken. Washed a load of towels and they did come out static free and soft but when I washed some clothes I was a little disappointed. Things were somewhat soft but missed the fresh scent from Snuggle or Downy that I normally use. This fabric softener was thin because of all the liquid so I did use quite a bit more then I would have with the name brand softener. I think this would work a lot better spritzed on a cloth and thrown in the dryer as a dryer sheet, Using a funnel to add the conditioner to your container would be a big help.

140664,133174,5,1,This is a wonderful way to prepare salmon.  I sprinkled the salmon with a seasoning salt and DH cooked them out on the grill then poured the wonderful glaze on top.  I would suggest allowing the glaze to cool down a little more than I did as initially it was a little thin.  It thickens nicely after it cools about 10 minutes.  Everyone enjoyed it!,2005-12-04

I really enjoyed the combination of the two potatoes with the garlic and white sauce.
However mine never really thickened and the cottage cheese added a lot of water in the end. Maybe adding an egg could sort this out...

You can always add a few drops of jalapeno juice, if you like extra heat. Always got lots of praise at potlucks with a big bowl of this stuff!",2011-03-14
100119,247405,5,1,"I served this with a Mexican-style vegetable soup and grapes.  Then I served this salad in a BIG bowl.  I told DH that this is all we're having.  He looked at it and said, where's the rest of the meal?  Then he started eating, and after a few bites said, this is good.  You can make this again.  This is one of the best salads I've ever had.  These are the things I changed.  I used soy crumbles and added onion poweder, garlic powder, chili powder, and a little cumin instead of the packet mix.  I bet ground turkey would be good, too.  I added chopped cucumber, and used chopped sweet onions and romaine lettuce.  For the tortilla chips, we used Tangos blue corn & berries.  The flavors melded together perfectly.  The Green Goddess dressing was perfect.  (Found it at Walmart) Thank you, Caroline, for an enjoyable meal.",2011-09-03

Next time I make it I will add more seasoning when cooking the meat as well as after adding the pineapple juice.

Ran out of white sauce so ended up with a final covering of greek yogurt.  Thank God there are leftovers for today. Will now be a favourite in OUR houshold as well.,2004-09-01

Changes I made were grated zuchinni added, diced tomatoes rather than tomatoes and mozzarella instead of tasty.",2010-04-09

85442,726534,4,1,"This was pretty good tasting but by the time it was finished cooking, the onions were soft and mushy, not exactly the way we like our stir-fries.  Next time I think I would stir-fry the onions as directed, then remove them from the pan while I stir-fried the livers, returning them to the pan once the livers were done cooking in the chicken broth/oyster sauce liquid.  I would also stir-fry a clove or two of fresh garlic with the onions, and add a little rice wine or dry sherry to chicken broth.  A drop or two of sesame oil would probably be delicious.  I think I'll try that next time.  Thanks for the recipe.",2008-05-02

I doubled on the chicken broth and oyster sauce because at the end I added stir-fry veggies to it and I also thickened the sauce up a bit with cornstarch just so it was more gravy like.

407601,138681,5,1,"Excellent! Well worth making! It is most important that you leave dough to relax - I put mine in covered bowl in the fridge for about 45 minutes. I managed to roll out by hand quite easily. Do try to get dough rolled out as thin as possible, as noodles will thicken up some when cooked. No need to dry out the fresh noodles! If you cook right away, they will be done in about 5 minutes, depending on how thin your noodles are.",2012-11-28

12959,35193,5,1,"Evie*, this is so delicious and easy!  My husband raved about it.  I didn't have softened butter to 'cream' the ingredients, so I melted the butter gently, then added the rest of the ingredients and poured over the asparagus.  Worked like a charm. And the tarragon butter can be made ahead of time and even frozen for future use.  I would use it on all kinds of things!  Thanks Evie* !  I love this kind of recipe!",2003-03-05
86195,24485,5,1,Not the prettiest cookie but WOW the flavor! These are completely addictive. Crusty but soft with a wonderful cinnamon taste. I had a cup of chopped walnuts handy and threw them in the filling. YUM!,2004-11-27

213634,515158,4,1,"I love the combo of ingredients, and will definitely make it again (esp. since I'm seriously hooked on coconut milk and cilantro), but I had a lot of trouble with this recipe -- no doubt my own fault. I made all the chunks too big (tofu and sweet potato) to start with. I couldn't get the tofu to brown; the sweet potatoes wanted to stick badly; and getting everything actually cooked through was something of a challenge somehow. But I found it delicious. I might bump up the curry paste just a bit (I used 2 generous teaspoons), but other than that it was plenty tasteful to me. Thanks for a great new recipe for this new vegan!",2007-09-22
213634,659260,5,1,My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this. I'm not a big fan of cilantro so I left it out and I added 2Tbsp of the curry sauce because we like our food spicey.,2007-11-28

128745,37456,5,1,"WOW, that was delicious. Will do again and again. I ended up using 3/4 cup of bread crumbs and added black pepper to them. Also, I chopped the garlic rather than crushing it, so that some remained on the pork schnitzel before I breaded them. Excellent.",2006-03-09
128745,222478,5,1,Great recipe Jen! The marination of the meat gave this a real edge over 'normal' pork schnitzel. I used this to cook Pork and Bacon Skewers (recipe #105636) as pictured but next time will try as a standalone dish.,2006-04-14

The first time I marinated it all day and that was too long (over flavored the meat), the next time I marinated for two hours and that still seemed to over season the meat, so I finally followed the directions and marinated for an hour and that was just perfect.  My husband especially loves schnitzel and this recipe sends it over the top for me.  I did use panko instead of breadcrumbs.",2008-01-06

I used raw medium shrimp that I cooked when I added the wine and they were done in just a couple of minutes.  My Swiss cheese had gone bad so used monterey jack which worked well.  I think next time I'll coarsely chop the shrimp.  I'll also put this in the crock pot to keep it warm.    Thanks Teresa for sharing this keeper.  Made for PRMR :),2009-11-22
396957,1564710,5,1,"I fixed this appetizer using some frozen cooked shrimp left over from a reception.  I chopped the shrimp as suggested by Nimz, but added a little more wine to juice up the shrimp-onion mixture.  I also subbed shredded Italian 4-cheese for the swiss.  We served it in a fondue-style chafing dish and it was a great hit at a recent ""I Hate Winter"" party.  Tostitos scoops and Wheat Thins flat bread were a great way to serve it up.  However, it would really do a number on my loctose-intolerant wife!",2010-02-27

Also, I added rosemary because I thought that would go nicely with the fruity tang of lemon and grapefruit. I think this greatly added to the recipe. Everyone who has tried them has LOVED them, even many people who aren't vegan and didn't even realize that they were vegan cookies. I want to experiment a little with the canola oil and see if replacing it with soy yogurt is better or not. In muffins, soy yogurt works really well to make them dense and creamy - that melt in your mouth feeling. I wish these cookies had a bit more of that feeling. Also, I might try adding vinegar to help them rise a bit because these cookies turn out very flat, skinny, and kind of crunchy.",2011-07-27
438624,1333516,5,1,"This is a great recipe! I used lemons from my lemon tree. It took about 5 medium sized lemons to equal the 2 Tbsp of fresh zest. I used my juicier to juice the lemons; I had leftover juice so I made fresh lemonade with it. Cookies are very easy to make, I followed the recipe but added 1/2 tsp of Sea Salt instead of 1/4 tsp. I baked it for about 10-12 mins in my gas oven. If you cook it until edges are brown then you get a crispy cookie. If you bake it no more than 10 mins, you will get a chewy cookie (which I prefer). My husband and 3 yo daughter loved the cookies. My mom-in-law thought they had a buttery taste, lol! I only bake vegan desserts, so this is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!",2012-01-23
438624,2343385,5,1,"I'm so glad these came up when I googled ""Vegan Lemon Cookies."" I wanted something easy, fast, and lemony and this fit the bill perfectly! I only made 1/4 of the recipe, which gave me 9 med/large cookies. I also replaced 1/3 of the oil with unsweetened applesauce. I may try reducing the sugar a bit next time. I needed to bake them for 12 minutes and they came out chewy wih a little crunch on the lightly-browned bottoms. The lemon taste was very prominent, which is great. Lots of thanks to the recipe poster!",2012-07-29
438624,2436291,5,1,Great recipe!  I only used 1 cup of sugar and will probably only use 3/4 cup next time. A review above suggested less sugar and I am glad I read that.   I also  replaced a 1/4 cup of regular flour with coconut flour.  These were really good!!  Thanks for sharing!!,2013-10-19
438624,1803468164,5,1,"These cookies are AMAZING!!! I pretty much just followed the recipe and they turned out fantastic. Only thing I did differently was to replace a third of the oil with applesauce and use a little less zest than indicated. Although my teeny, tiny, temperamental studio oven bakes really unevenly and some cookies ended up a little more well done than the others, they all turned out to be delicious! I put a little store bought icing on them and that was great but they are scrumptious and plenty sweet without icing. Thanks for a great recipe!",2014-12-07
438624,2000163466,4,1,"Flavor was great, though I only had one lemon so made do with the zest of that and then 1/4 tsp of lemon zest. WAY too much oil though; the dough was very greasy. Cookies bake very flat, with chewy insides and crispy edges; addictive. All in all: I will make these again, but cut back on the oil and probably a bit of sugar too.",2015-05-18
438624,2000306956,5,1,"About two years ago, my friend and I had some extra lemons and wanted to find a recipe that would use them up. We found this recipe, and it was a miracle. The taste: perfect. The texture: perfect. These. Cookies. Are. Perfect. It is a good thing that each batch makes so many cookies, because only about half of the dough ends up in the oven, if you know what I mean. My friends (vegan and non-vegan alike) beg for these cookies, and now I purposely go out to by lemons to make them; they are no longer for leftovers. I am about to make some more to send in a care package to my boyfriend -- lucky him!

438624,63878,5,1,Delicious and so easy! I used a good sized cookie scoop so mine might have been larger and so they took 15 min to start browning around the edge. I ended up with 31 cookies. This is a total keeper. Next time I will try reducing sugar a bit and then sprinkle sugar on top.,2017-08-13

As you can see in my picture, the first 2 shown (lower left) I made using my 1” cookie scoop, they came out way too big, ran together &amp; stuck to the sheet. I highly recommend using parchment paper and allowing more room in between each cookie than usual.",2018-03-18

The dough was too dry at first, but I started working a little at a time by hand then it was moist and perfect to drop on my cookie sheet. My finished cookies look like the pictures, but don’t taste anything like the other reviews. Not even icing will improve theses cookies. I’m a baker of delicious cakes and I have always eaten good desserts, but since I eat vegan foods I thought to try these cookies at home. I don’t know if it’s because I love great sweets that I think they taste nasty or because they would taste that way to anyone who tried them.",2018-07-08

503895,440735,5,1,These were DIVINE! Sad to say but this was pretty much my dinner last night. The other sad thing is my DH and kids don&#039;t like pecans; these brownines will be all mine.  I used light brown sugar instead of dark which the recipe didn&#039;t suffer from it.  I am not a fan of Almond extract but you could not taste it.  This was very easy and yummy.

118935,28346,5,1,"Fantastic!  I made this last week using some of the nice Maker's Mark bourbon I'd bought.  Very easy to put together.  I divided the batter into 2 loaf pans and then added the pecans to one pan as we have some nut allergies to contend with.  The only issue I had was deciding when enough baking was enough.  At one hour the centers were still pretty goopy, so I kept going another 5 minutes at a time.  Finally after probably 15 more minutes I took them out as they were as brown as I could deal with on the oustides, yet still a bit less cooked in the middle than I'd hoped.  Cooled, wrapped and refrigerated them and found the texture to be just fine when we tried some.  My finacé threatened to pick up the loaf and just gnaw on it.  Great recipe.",2005-12-30

167509,2001466487,3,0,These turned out flavorless. I ate two and my hubby ate 1/2 of one and we tossed the rest. I used store brand bran cereal because they didn't carry the All-Bran brand. It looked comparable so I think it was this recipe but it could have been the cereal that was the problem.,2017-04-01
206369,178682,3,0,"It was definitely healthy, and lightly spiced (I like super-spicy food). It doesn't brown up as much as it's traditionally breaded and fried cousin, but I would certainly make it again if I was making overly unhealthy dishes, just so they somewhat balance themselves out (I made this with super-UNhealthy mac 'n cheese!)",2007-01-25
224885,457321,3,0,"I used firm silken tofu, since the recipe didn't specify, and I don't know if it was that, or the fact that the air in my house is really dry (drying out the flour), but I ended up with more of a dough than a batter.  After 15 minutes in the oven, though, it tasted and looked like muffins.  I was disappointed in how boring these muffins are, though.  I was expecting something sweeter, with more honey flavor.  They're good if you serve them with honey or jam, and they'd be better with the addition of some fruit, like raisins or cut-up peaches.  I might try that next time, since I still have leftover rice to use up.",2008-01-06
263410,88099,5,1,"I would give this 10 stars if I could.  This is hands down the best Sweet and Sour Pork recipe I've ever made or had.  The flavors were just perfect.  I did make some changes, only in the way I cooked the pork for diet reasons.  I stir-fried the salt and peppered pork in a little olive oil until browned, then placed it in a warm oven to stay warm.  I also used splenda in place of the sugar and some fresh sweet pineapple, and used the water option, but other than that, made as is.  I can't tell you how much we enjoyed this.    Thanks for a keeper that is going right into my 2007 favorite recipes.",2007-11-17
263410,455641,5,1,"This was so yummy! Not too sweet, it was excellent, we loved it. I didn't deep fry them though, I just pan fried them, but wow, restaurant quality dish :)",2007-11-22
263410,780172,5,1,"This was very good, a very good mix of sweet and sour flavor. I did not use a fryer, just fried them in my electric fry pan and it turned out great. Only change I will make next time is to use the water instead of the pineapple juice, it was a tad sweeter than I like.",2008-03-06
263410,222478,5,1,Really great! I also found the level of sweetness perfect. Rather than deep-fry I shallow fried the pork in a large pan with enough hoit oil to cover about 50% and gave all the pieces of pork a single turn. It meant being able to cook all the pork in a single batch so was probably just as fast as deep frying in a few batches.,2008-07-25
263410,204024,5,1,"We had to add a bit more cornstarch at the finish to thicken this up, and we all thought it could have been a little more ""sweet"" and a little less ""sour"" -- but that's exactly what the poster liked about it, so ""it's a feature, not a bug.""  And who could complain?  My family went after this as if their names were Hoover and Kirby!  Colorful and tasty!  Made for PRMR, Feb. 2009.",2009-02-09
263410,102058,5,1,5 Stars! Even not so pork loving DH liked this and like other reviewers we too found that this wasn't too  overpoweringly sweet as some recipe tend to be so that's the main reason we enjoyed this so much. We used PeterJ's method to fry the pork too and it worked well. Please see my Rating system: 5 stars for an easy and tasty pork recipe that we will be making again. Thanks!,2009-02-26
191682,229589,5,1,Found this really a nice change. My kids loved it but it was not too sweet for them. I did not use the cooking spray as I did not have any and worked just as well. Thanks for the Recipe,2007-02-28
191682,324390,5,1,If you like cinnamon toast you have to give this a try. I used microwave popcorn and this came together so quickly and I ate it quickly too! Next time you have a movie night don't forget this popcorn.,2007-03-13
191682,308889,5,1,Very delicious!  Just like cinnamon toast!,2007-03-27
191682,121690,5,1,"Fabulous, and I love that the flavorings don't add much in the way of calories or fat! Will make often!",2007-04-04
191682,104295,5,1,My pantry is almost bare due to the upcoming move but the kids and I wanted a snack.  Luckily I remembered a container of popcorn kernels and this recipe.  I popped the corn on the top of the stove with a bit of oil (1/2 tbsp).  I used splenda instead of sugar and 1 1/2 tsp. of butter instead of the tablespoons.  This truly tastes like cinnamon toast on popcorn.  Great snack!,2007-08-25
191682,126104,5,1,"This was very good.  I used Orville's ""kettle corn"", which is slightly sweeter than regular popcorn.  I used sugar (will try Splenda next time), and it was delicious.  I will probably go a little heavier on the cinnamon and Splenda, just because I love cinnamon, but it was find just as written.",2007-10-30
191682,422893,4,1,This was a nice quick snack to put together. I used butter spray so left out the butter and used Splenda in place of sugar. A good way to get a sugar fix whilst still remaining healthy. Thanks for posting!,2007-11-03
191682,336058,4,1,"We pop popcorn on the stove, so used some oil.  Forgot to drizzle margarine and we had some.  Then I drizzled the marg. and tossed and I think, with the popping oil, the margarine wouldn't have to be used, for a lower fat snack.  Made for Zaar Stars.",2008-02-10
191682,89831,5,1,"Great treat, I used salted popcorn so I omitted the extra 1/2 teaspoon salt, also I increased the sugar a few teaspoons, thanks for sharing Reds!",2008-04-23
191682,30209,5,1,"YUM!!!  My 4 yo asked for kettle corn.  I made this, and she was very pleased!  :o)  I used 2 Tablespoons of unpopped popcorn.  I put them in a paper bag (sealed with tape) in the microwave.  It took a little less than 2 minutes to cook.  Then I drizzled a little butter and added a teaspoon of the sugar / cinnamon / salt mixture.  Mmmmmmm . . .",2008-08-30
191682,491337,3,0,It was okay. I didn't like the flavor combination on popcorn but my kids like it pretty well. I'm sure it is just a person preference for me.,2008-12-10
191682,469903,5,1,Wow - I really loved this cinnamon popcorn! DH makes air popped popcorn nearly every night - the sugar/cinnamon was a nice change from plain ol' popcorn. I'm looking forward to making this again tonight!,2009-02-04
191682,678366,5,1,I liked this popcorn.,2009-10-21

191682,350750,5,1,"Quick and tasty, thank you!",2012-05-15
151696,4470,4,1," I am not awarding stars because I think I made a couple of errors making this recipe.  The flavor was excellent but they were very soft and very difficult to flip on the pan, they wanted to fall apart (and did)  The recipe says chop chicken very fine - mine was 1/4"" dice, the recipe says 1/2 cup patties - mine were larger.  My beans sprouts were well drained but still had some moisture on them. Next time I will use fresh bean sprouts.  The sauce is very easy and perfect for the patties.  I will make it again but to be fair I think it was the cook at fault here not the recipe.  I did enjoy the flavor

Added comments -I made these again, vegetarian, omitted the chicken and increased the flour to 1/2 cup. Used all fresh vegetables.  They were lovely",2006-10-31
329242,375894,5,1,"Thank you, Iewe, this was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly, but since I didn't have any left over mashed potatoes, I had to make them.  Next time, I will play with it a little, because it came out a bit soupy.  It was probably that I made the mashed potatoes a bit too soupy to start with.  I will definitely be doing it again, there is not doubt about that.  We loved it.  Thanks again.
Kayne",2009-01-05
329242,280271,5,1,Delicious! Mine came out a bit runny too. So I would suggest (if you don't like it runny) not beating it at high speed. At the end of cooking time I threw it under the broiler to brown the topping. Thanks for posting. :),2010-01-18
329242,58104,4,1,Here ya have real comfort food! I like the ease of having this prepared before hand Just to pop in the oven when needed. I did use a herb cream cheese. Didn`t need all the topping. And I would skip the flout next time. Thanks Made for ZWT 2011,2011-06-24
281278,242766,5,1,Delicious! We loved these quick and easy tuna steaks.  The marinade added a wonderful flavor to the tuna. It was tangy from the lime juice and zingy from the red pepper...yummy!  I used Ahi tuna steaks which I marinated for about 1-1/2 hours.  I grilled them on the barbeque until they were medium rare. My family loved these and gave them 2-thumbs up.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe...it is definitely a keeper!,2008-03-29
281278,664225,5,1,I have been dying to have some tuna on the grill and this recipe was amazing!  We loved it nice and pink in the middle - The only way to cook tuna!  The flavors complimented each other and made for a very tasty piece of fish.  My company all gave it 5 stars and said it was worth more!,2008-06-01
281278,521211,5,1,"Great recipe, this tuna was so deliciouis it had an oriental feel.  I used roasted sesame oil and lemon juice and it worked just fine.

281278,222096,5,1,Seared the steaks for a couple of minutes on each side and they were almost well done. MY tuna was only 2 stars.  It was dry and chewy.  But YOUR tuna recipe deserves 5 stars because the flavor was truly distinctive.  I make tuna steaks often.  Most of the time they come out rare to medium rare.  This was one of the easiest and tastiest recipe I have tried.,2010-10-28
281278,175574,5,1,"This is an excellent recipe.  A tip for anyone who wound up with tuna that was too well done.  I had bought frozen tuna steaks, and they were not defrosted all the way when I grilled them.  I followed the instructions of 3 min per side and I wound up with basically something like a tuna tataki (it was just warm in the middle and still totally rare)  the flavors are outstanding and I don't even think I marinated quite as long as the recipe called for.  Keeper recipe! (Served with stir fry snow peas and red peppers and some jasmine rice, perfect ""Asian inspired"" meal)",2012-05-09
281278,1800322898,5,1,Absolutely delicious!!  Made the marinade for just one steak but it was fabulous!,2014-02-17

95728,56087,5,1,"What a great salad.  Only things I did different was to omit the garbonzo beans, as I don't like them, and I didn't mix the dressing into the entire salad as hubby doesn't like balsamic.  SUPERB.. can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing and congrats on you football pool win.",2004-12-05
95728,37636,5,1,"This is an interesting and delicious salad! I used Greek dressing on mine as I didn't have the bottled dressing. While it has some Greek-type elements, it doesn't really have an overwhelming sense of that, as the avocado and garbanzos take it in a much different direction, in some ways slightly Italian tasting, and in some ways Middle Eastern. So I can see how the balsamic would be an excellent choice (the Greek dressing was as well), but since I don't generally use bottled dressings, I would probably try just mixing up a simple balsamic vinaigrette instead. Thanks for posting!",2004-12-07
95728,141293,5,1,"This is my standard salad.  I love the addition of the olives, avocados, and garbonzos.  Delicious combination.",2004-12-15
95728,103876,5,1,Great salad!  I used romaine and mixed greens and came up short on the avocado since my husband ate it before I had a chance to make the salad.  I also used light italian dressing with a little added balsamic vinegar since that was what I had in.  I especially like the garbanzo beans in this.  I will definitely make again.,2005-01-09
95728,136979,5,1,I made this salad for a large family gathering and everyone raved!   My husband said it was one of the best salad he's ever had.  Thanks,2005-12-27

437549,542159,5,1,"Wonderful! This is so simple, quick, easy and very tasty. Made as written using whole wheat couscous. The chicken stock really brings a lot of flavor to this side. DH like the little sweetness of the currants and I liked the crunch of the toasted pine nuts. Thanks so much for the post.",2010-09-23
437549,286566,5,1,"I scaled this back for 2 serves and as the only side it filled 3 of us more than adequately.  The only changes I made was to use olive oil instead of butter and use sultanas in place of the currants otherwise made to recipe and think using the chicken stock added a nice flavour instead of using water.

317182,498271,4,1,This is a simple and tasty dinner recipe!  The sauce was flavorful and I liked the green beans cooked in with the meat.  I'd like to try adding some cubed or sliced potatoes next time to make it a true meal-in-a-dish.  Thanks for posting this recipe!,2009-01-29

315879,383346,5,1,This is so yummy.  Very easy to do.  My son really liked it.  I tasted it and then he didn't want me to touch it LOL  I omitted the nuts cause he's not crazy about them.  I used whipped cream in a can.  Thanks Annacia :)  Made for Newest Zaar tag,2010-10-03

Given that dh isn't a big lamb fan and ds has the nickname of ""Mr. Picky"", this is really saying something.

Also, I'd put the chicken up on a rack to keep it off of the drippings so the bacon would crisp up more.  I added sliced fresh mushrooms over the tops of all of the breasts.  Then, the last 10 minutes of baking, I covered the pans with foil in order to steam the mushrooms.

It is a keeper and I will be spreading the word about this one!,2005-06-08
79944,147175,4,1,"I really liked this chicken dish. My husband however (VERY picky eater) Wasn't to keen on it, he said it was good ( I think to spare my feelings, because he only ate about half the chicken breast I put on his plate). However if you don't have picky eaters I do recomend this dish, it has a very rich flavor,  make sure you get that bacon crispy.",2005-06-22
79944,192849,5,1,"Tish...this is a fabulous recipe.  I halved it (there are only two of us at home) and froze 2 breasts in each of 2 packages for later.  Instead of the listed cream cheese, I made recipe #111489 Garlic & Herb Cream Cheese Spread.  Everything else was exactly as written.  Decadent, yummy enough to impress company...easy!  Thanks for sharing!",2005-07-30
79944,168921,5,1,"This was so easy and yummy! What's not to like? Chicken, cream cheese and bacon...mmmm! I was really lazy and defrosted the chicken breast in the microwave, flattened it, cooked it some more in the microwave, added the cream cheese and bacon, and then finished cooking it in the microwave. It was very fast and easy...Thanks for posting!",2005-08-02
79944,157785,5,1,I LOVED THIS! This fits perfectly into low carb diets and is a great addition to my OAMC freezer. DH (who is picky) loved it too. I fudged through on the cream cheese bc I didn't have any on hand. I also didn't want to commit to 12 servings when I wasn't sure if DH would eat it. I am going to make a full recipe of it this weekend and always have it on hand! ,2005-08-25
79944,39194,5,1,"Tish, this was very good!  I did add some minced garlic to the cream cheese cuz I love garlic!  I made these and froze them, and now have them at the ready.  Very easy to do and very tasty as well. Thank you fellow Nevadan! :)",2005-08-26
79944,129796,5,1,"These were great, I didn't include the salt or the butter and I used prosciutto instead of bacon. I did however find them a little dry but am assuming the butter would fix this, I will put this in next time I make them.",2005-08-30

79944,149363,5,1,"Tish, you obviously have another winner on your hands!
I made this last week, but had far too many so I froze the rest fully cooked.
I just flash froze them on a cookie sheet and then put them in a zip-lock bag. We thawed them out last night and they were just as great as the first time around! So they DO freeze well when pre-cooked.
Thanks for a great addition to my OAMC cookbook!

79944,101823,4,1,"I downsized this recipe for only 2 chicken breasts, as I was only serving my husband and myself.  3 tablespoons of cream cheese seemed like a lot for each breast, and I reduced that amount to better suit our tastes.  I also could see no reason for the added butter or salt and omitted them.  My chicken rolled nicely and didn't need toothpicks for securing.  The bacon added a nice flavor dimension to the chicken and creamy filling.  This was simple to prepare and made an easy meal for a weeknight.",2005-10-07
79944,209942,5,1,"I also adapted and downsized this recipe for just 2 of us...should have made more!  DH raved.  I added a dash of Tapatio hot sauce.I will make this again...DH insists!...and tinker with it, for our tastes.  Great recipe..Thanks for posting!",2005-10-13

Thank you for this lovely dish!",2005-11-18
79944,20129,5,1,"When I first saw this recipe today, I knew I had to make it.  I was missing a few ingredients, but it was a just a test.  WE loved this.  I had two chicken breasts, some Rondele garlic and herb cheese, PRECOOKED bacon, butter, salt and pepper.  When that's what you have, that's what you use:) 

I didn't have to broil the chicken to crisp the bacon, but I did spray the chicken with garlic flavored pam and cover with foil when I thought it might be drying out.  I used 4 slices of precooked bacon per rolled chicken breast.

I also used individual casserole dishes to cook this in, so all the delicious sauce was right there.  Wonderful dish.  I will be making this again with the correct ingredients, but I really don't see how it could be better than the meal we had tonight.

Thank you, Tish, for this 5 star addition to my cookbook.",2005-11-18

79944,146742,5,1,"I made this along with 2 other main-dishes for 14 guests who came for dinner, and it was a big hit, and the first to go. I used a large round Wolfgang  Puck roasting pan and spiraled the bottom of the pan with the chicken rolls.  I made them small, and they looked so fancy. The melted butter that layered the bottom of the pan after they baked, made a nice sauce to spoon over the chicken, and it just melted in the mouth. This is a keeper.",2005-12-09
79944,186070,5,1,"This was great, although I did not use the cheese (picky eaters)I only had 3 chicken breasts which I filleted and coated with garlic power, cayenne, cumin and some oregano. I rolled up the chicken and wrapped in bacon and cooked it, it was wonderful.  Thank you.",2005-12-10
79944,11297,5,1,A good company recipe as you can have it ready to cook well before needed. Goes well with either a salad or hot vegetables and a potato dish. You can also vary the flavours of the cream cheese.  A really versatile recipe. Thanks for posting :),2006-01-10
79944,267361,5,1,"Wonderfully easy-to-make with delicious results!  I halved recipe and added a pound of fresh whole white button mushrooms in-between the chicken rolls.

79944,338435,4,1,"Delicious!  everyone loved it.  The flavors were great together. I would advise setting the cream cheese out for 10 minutes or so just to let it become a nice consistency for spreading onto the chicken.  Also, after the chicken breasts were pounded the wraps were quite large so I used 2 pieces of bacon for each wrap.  Will be making this recipe a lot in the future.  Thanks",2006-07-30

79944,51011,4,1,"I thought that this was pretty good, but dh didn't really care for it.  He thought that it was too salty (guess from the bacon). He can be picky when it comes to new things though.  It was easy to put together (I used thin chicken cutlets).  Thanks for sharing.",2006-09-04

79944,208755,5,1,"Wow! This was the first thing ever that I tried making for the purpose of freezing ahead (though my BF couldn't stand the thought of not cooking and eating them right then because they looked so good). I'm a novice at cooking, and these were incredibly easy while looking really fancy. Tonight we had them for dinner, and they were even better than either of us expected. Truly restaurant quality taste! Since BF doesn't like onion or chives, I took someone else's suggestion of making Garlic & Herb Cream Cheese Spread (<a href=""/111489"">Garlic &amp; Herb Cream Cheese Spread</a>). Couldn't believe how nicely the flavors from the cream cheese made its way into the chicken and how roasted on the outside and juicy on the inside. The bacon on top was just more deliciousness on top of already heaven. Can't wait until it's time to pull more of these out of the freezer. Thank you so much!",2006-10-04

79944,305187,5,1,"I had to try this after I read the ingredients! I didn't have chive and onion cream cheese so I just mixed in some garlic and green onion-it was so good! I also used the tenderloins which I think made it quicker, and hickory smoked bacon was all I had but it eliminated the need to season the chicken. Thank you for a great recipe! ",2006-10-24
79944,246482,5,1,"We had this for supper and it was a hit.The chicken was so tender you could cut it with the fork. I used plain cream cheese and added garlic chives from my garden and 1 clove of garlic.
Very easy to make and  I will make more and freeze them for future suppers.
I served a salad and green beans and french bread along with it.

Thank you for posting a superb recipe.",2006-11-11

79944,201762,5,1,Oh these were sooo good!! I only made four but wish I had made more to stick in the freezer. I used much less cream cheese than called for in the recipe. I just spread it thinly over the flattened breast before rolling it up. I also laid an additional slice of bacon over the top of each breast. Then I poured a large can of drained mushroom pieces over the top. Next time I'm going to add some mushrooms over the cream cheese before rolling the breasts. I cooked for half the time and then flipped them over and cooked the rest of the time. No need to use the broiler. The bacon was nicely browned on both sides. I served them sliced with the mushrooms spooned over the slices...it made a beautiful presentation. This will become one of our favorite and often cooked recipes. Thanks for posting it!,2006-11-16

I think we would love it with the Garlic and herb as another reviewer mentioned. It only took a little time to get it all together. I really was great to have ready to go, we had a family member ill and needed help with meals for her family, no problem I cooked it up and sent over a nutritious meal.",2007-01-13

To avoid a trip to the store and to make use of what I had, I added one packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix to 1 carton of cream cheese (I halved the recipe).  Turned out great!

It's Fantastic, and omg, for me to serve something that looked so fancy shmancy with such little headache...wow! I immediately tried the freezer method, and then thawed some for the first taste test, and they were great!  Phew, because I have 9 more in the freezer.
Oh, I used a toothpick and those colored ones left a blue dye mark in them - a small thing, but won't use those again.  I flash froze, then wrapped each one in foil, then put in a zipper bag.  Easy peasy.  Thanks Tish!",2007-06-23

79944,357987,4,1,"I thought this was very tasty, but really hard to pound the chicken breasts.  I also thought it was too much meat per person.  Next time I would start off with chicken tenders or possibly filet the larger breasts so they're only half as thick.  I was worried even after all the pounding that the chicken wasn't done in the middle or the cream cheese didn't get hot enough.    Good flavor and very simple other than the pounding!

I bought a ""value pack"" (18 pieces) & the thighs were already 1/2"" so no pounding was needed. I wrapped each in plastic wrap before putting them into a ziplock bag to freeze. I kept two out & made them for dinner. My husband really loved them & said I should share this recipe with his grown daughter for her family.

The only thing that I do different, is to make my own fresh herb cream cheese mixture instead of the store bought variety. I have a question for those having trouble with the bacon not being cooked enough, are you using the broiler for the last 5-10 minutes? I do, and I don't even pre-cook the bacon like suggested, and the end result is visual and taste perfection. The one thing that I REALLY like about this recipe is that you can refrigerate the left overs and then cut them into 1/4"" pinwheels the next day for snacks, to put on top of a salad, or to use as hor dourves. This dish also goes great with a light Bernaise sauce, the distinct flavoring of tarragon, shallots, and chervil just makes it even more mouthwatering! It's a keeper Tish!",2008-02-22
79944,749562,5,1,Very tasty and exploding with flavor!  My picky husband loved these.  I had trouble wrapping the bacon around my chicken breasts because the breasts I used were really large and I couldn't get then thin enough so I cut them in half before rolling and wrapping bacon and they were very tasty!  I decided not to use any butter or salt because I thought that the juices and sodium from the bacon and cheese would be enough.  I was correct and it was very flavorful without it.  I will definitely be putting this into the family meal rotation.  Very pleasing look without all the work.  Thank you Tish!,2008-02-26
79944,428060,4,1,"Chicken thighs were on sale so I just dumped all of the ingredients in a pan. The chicken was flavorful, and it made a really tasty sauce.

79944,571308,5,1,"I knew this was a winner before I even made it. I had 6 large boneless skinless breasts and instead of flattening them, I butterflied them and sliced into 2 pieces. We had one each for dinner that night and I froze the rest on a cookie sheet and then placed in a freezer bag. The 2 we had for dinner were delicious- not dry at all even tho I had to cook them a little longer than 40 minutes- probably 10 minutes more. The bacon was done. I didn't need to broil it. The cheese filling was just right. I've had trouble in the past with stuffed chicken breasts. They didn't roll well and the stuffing had all but disappeared by the time the chicken was done but NOT this time.
I've added this to my OAMC cook book and will be passing this recipe onto my friends.

79944,781485,5,1,This was the best! I only made 6 chicken breasts and I did not use the butter or salt; didn't need it! My kids saw it come out of the oven and were in awe. Then they tasted it and said it was great! I see it becoming one of my family's favorite recipes!,2008-04-07
79944,750473,5,1,"WOW! What a surprise to the tastebuds. I was so excited smelling the house while this cooked. I made 6 breasts and froze 4. I did add the butter, but no salt - it didn't need any. This was a delight - and my Dh loved it! We served this with chiken flavored noodles and lemon butter brocoli steamed! YUMMO! I'm excited to have 2 more dinners of this waiting on us! I did cook mine at 375 degrees for 30 minutes, then rest for 5 min's then broiled for 2 min's - rotating after one minute - not to burn any part of the bacon. It was nice and crisp! Thank you very much!",2008-04-15
79944,230309,5,1,"I was so pleased with how the chicken turned out that I've made it twice now.  I did not add the butter, but I did add salt.  I also used turkey bacon and it was yummy!  Great OAMC meal!",2008-04-30
79944,269331,5,1,"Wow, wow, wow!  Can I say WOW again!  This was so easy to make, but definitely company worthy.  I halved the recipe and used chicken cutlets slightly pounded.  THANKS FOR POSTING!  Iâ€™ll be making this again for sure!",2008-06-04
79944,518581,5,1,Very good!  I mixed onion and red bell pepper with plain cream cheese but didn't use as much as the recipe called for-- BIG mistake!  Next time I won't skimp.  Thanks for posting!,2008-06-05
79944,564378,5,1,Thanks for another great recipe Tish. I used up some leftover boursin cheese and now make these regularly and cook them on my george forman grill.,2008-07-07
79944,125640,4,1,"I cut back to only two tablespoons of cream cheese per chicken breast and sprinkled with garlic salt instead of regular, but otherwise made as posted. Baked up nicely. Easy and good. Thanks for sharing.",2008-07-13
79944,728508,5,1,Soooo yummy! Tons of flavor and keeps the chicken nice and moist. Also great as a OAMC recipe. Very easy to prepare with ingredients that I always have on hand.,2008-07-22
79944,86359,5,1,Just add me to all the rest who think this is delish.  Didn't change a thing,2008-08-28
79944,467492,5,1,"These were great, and my family loved them.  I used the thin cut chicken breasts (saved the pounding time) and served with Jasmine Rice / Black Beans with a squash / zuchinni medley.  Very hardy dinner, with a diverse boquet of flavors!",2008-09-09
79944,463126,5,1,"Very tasty and quick recipe. I didn't even bother to flatten the chicken, though the breasts I used were not thick to begin with. Skipped the butter. Will make this again!",2008-10-05
79944,685054,5,1,We loved it!  I made mine seperate without the cream cheese and it was still delicious!,2008-10-07
79944,819616,5,1,"Love this recipe!  My husband gets really excited when I make it and a huge smile creeps onto his face.  I made a few modifications to the recipe and it was incredible (but it did take a little longer).  I mixed cream cheese with fresh chopped chives and chili pepper flakes.  I pre-cooked the bacon until crispy (mmmâ€¦â€¦crispy bacon) and rolled it all inside the pounded chicken breasts.  After securing the rolled bundles with toothpicks, I pan seared them in olive oil for a few minutes on each side, browning the chicken.  Lastly I cooked the seared bundles in the oven at 400 degrees for approximately 20 minutes.  Yum-o-luscious!",2008-09-10
79944,452045,5,1,Brilliant recipe. Couldn't find chive and onion cream cheese so added 60ml of fine diced brown onion and 40 ml of snipped chives to 250 gms of plain cream cheese and a pinch of salt and it worked like a dream. Am now going to experiment with other flavours like herb and garlic others have mentioned. So simple so delightful.,2008-09-10
79944,926084,5,1,"Deee-liscious....thankyou. I couldn't thin my chicken pieces, and too small to cut, so I decided to spread the ingredients on top of the chicken and cover with the bacon.  I cooked them on my George Foreman Griller (cooks the top and bottom at the same time).  They cooked in about 10 mins and the bacon was nice and crispy.  I have shared your recipe with my family in Perth Western Australia.",2008-09-11

I changed it up a bit as personal pref with 1# spinach frozen/thawed, 6 oz. cream cheese (blended with spinach) and a spice blend on top consisting of season-all, salt pepper and garlic powder.  I baked in over for appprox 55 minutes.  Delicious and super quick once you get everything together!",2008-09-15
79944,889443,5,1,Excellent meal! I ended up with HUGE thick chicken so I was not able to pound it down thin. I think it would have been even better if I could have.  Thank you for the recipe :],2008-09-16
79944,609478,5,1,"Great idea! I used some Philly Pineapple cream cheese instead of the Garlic & Herb. I knew it was going to be a little plain, so I bought a bottle of katsu bbq sauce and used it as a dipping sauce. Tasted fantastic.",2008-09-17
79944,716950,3,0,"Nothing wrong with it, just my own personnal taste. I wasn't crazy about the cream cheese texture in the middle, altough my 4 year old announced after dinner ""Mommy, that was DELICIOUS! Can you make that again?"" LOL",2008-09-19
79944,360127,5,1,"I really liked this recipe. I made it hte other night for hubby and I.  He is not a big fan of chicken, and I was waiting for the usual complaints about me making him eat chicken (poor baby!). No complaints!! He really liked it, and said he would really like to have it again!  It was really quite easy, but looked so flash. Now that I have given them a test run, I will have to make some to freeze.",2008-09-21
79944,658717,5,1,This is one of my favorite recipes. I also add jalapenos to the creamcheese.,2008-09-23
79944,97780,4,1,We enjoyed this.  I was afraid the chive and onion cream cheese would be overpowering but the end result was much milder than expected.,2008-09-23

79944,291947,1,0,"I just recently attended a baby shower where this was served.  It was dry and leather like.  I did not eat mine, it was terrible.  I am anxious to cook this on my own to see if I can keep the chicken from drying out.  Any suggestions out there?",2008-09-30
79944,968749,5,1,"I made this last night and got the two-thumbs-up from DH.  He's not even a fan of cream cheese OR white meat chicken, but because the chicken was so moist and full of flavor, he really liked it and was glad to hear that we had two more dinners worth in the freezer for a later date!  That said, we'll definitely be having this again!  As for dry chcken from the last poster - maybe they over cooked it?  Mine was very juicy.  Any over-cooked meat will taste like leather.",2008-09-30
79944,866907,5,1,this was awesome!! I halved the recipe for a small group of friends. WOW what a hit! I thought this was easy and looked like I had a caterer. I will use again and again. Thanks for posting,2008-10-04
79944,854216,5,1,"I love the chicken and the bacon, but the cream cheese wasn't my favorite part.  I love cream cheese, but I think there was too much on the chicken!  I think I put less than three TBS on each piece of chicken.  Next time I would use even less.  My husband loved it all around.",2008-10-05
79944,35714,5,1,"Wow! I cooked the entire batch then individually wrapped them and froze them. My DH can grab one from the freezer and toss it in his lunch cooler. It works out great, by noontime it is good to zap for 2 minutes and he has a great lunch! Very Messy to put together, but well worth it. I to skipped the butter and salt, and I used thick cut bacon. Great recipe!",2008-10-05
79944,988578,5,1,"I made this for my roomates and boyfriend and they loved it! I was skeptical at first but this was easier than I thought. Definately will make again! If you're on a budget, you can always split the chicken breasts in half. Follows the same instructions, just add less cream cheese. Thanks for sharing!",2008-10-13
79944,48612,5,1,"I subscribe to the ""everything is better with bacon"" philosophy, and this recipe proves it!  This is incredibly easy to make - the hardest part is pounding the chicken to the desired thickness.  We did these as an OAMC recipe, and I think it was the second or third one that we ate because they just looked so good sitting there in the freezer.  The only thing I did differently was I flipped the rolls over and broiled them on both sides so my bacon would get crispy all the way around.  Next time I'll bake a little less (maybe 30 minutes) to allow for the extra broiling.  Fantastic recipe!",2008-10-17
79944,609434,2,0,Great idea - I guess we are just not fans of the chive and onion cream cheese.  I may try again with an herbed goat cheese.,2008-10-19

79944,744299,5,1,"This was a very easy wonderfully tasting chicken dinner.  My husband loved this and so did I .  For my picky eaters I reserved two of the chicken breast and cooked them with just some bacon draped over them for flavor and they loved it.  A keeper for this family.  I served this with chicken rice, green beans, and fresh buscuits.  Yum, Yum.  Thanks Tish.",2008-10-21
79944,376098,5,1,"So delicious!  This is only my second attempt at making Oamc, and this dish was a huge hit at my house.  I used whipped cream cheese, and I found that I didn't use as much as the recipe called for, but it didn't seem to affect the taste at all, because everybody loved it.  Thanks for the winner!",2008-10-21
79944,456799,2,0,"I made these up last monday and cooked them tonight. I cooked them first in the oven and finished on the grill to crisp the bacon. I am sorry to say that we were not impressed at all with this recipe, I was hoping for something great with all the reviews here but to us it was bland and nothing grand. I even used spices on the chicken as I grilled it and I brushed it with butter also but we just did not care for it. I liked recipe #167880 so much better. Thanks for the recipe it was worth a try. Maybe if you marinated the chicken it would give it more flavor. It just was not for my family.",2008-10-29

I have made this twice in the last two weeks (with some extras in the freezer) and I'm thinking that they will probably hit our table on a weekly basis from now on.  Thanks!",2008-11-07
79944,286851,3,0,"After all the good reviews and with how easy this was, I was hoping to like it more. It wasn't bad, my family just didn't really care for it. There was so much cream cheese, and I didn't think it added a whole lot to the dish. It was very easy to make, with simple ingredients and directions, however, I don't believe we'll make this again. Thanks for sharing, however.",2008-11-16
79944,859379,5,1,"This was very good, quite a presentation.  Next time I will and more than just salt n Pepper for seasoning.  If you use your imagination you could do lots with this recipe, maybe add spinach or mush.",2008-11-18
79944,246266,3,0,"This was just okay for us.  I had hoped it would have had more flavor than it did, but if turned out rather bland.  The first ones we cooked were baked in the oven, and even though they looked very nice on the plate, they just really seemed to be lacking in flavor.  The next time we thawed some out to make, I wrapped an additional slice of peppered bacon around each breast and we cooked them in the smoker.  We liked them much better when cooked this way, but I probably won't be making any more to freeze.",2008-11-18
79944,630176,5,1,This was very easy to make and tasted delicious. My Husband Loved it. The cream cheese and bacon give it alot of flavor and keep the chicken nice and tender. I cooked mine for longer because I detest uncooked bacon. I also turned it as it was cooking so the bacon would brown evenly. Thank you  for posting this recipe.,2008-11-25
79944,368277,5,1,"I'm going to give this 5 stars on what it would have tasted like if my husband wouldn't have shown up 2 hrs late for supper and dried out the chicken. I couldn't believe how good it tasted even after all that! I can only imagine what it would have tasted like the first time! I can't wait to try to make it again! They were pretty darn easy to put together. I had some left over 1/3rd slices of bacon, so I just put them on top of the chicken breasts and it worked just fine. I couldn't believe how wonderful these smelled in the oven while they cooked! Thanks Tish!",2008-12-01
79944,44383,5,1,"Excellent. Didn't change a thing although my bacon was the extra thick stuff so didn't wrap as well as regular bacon would have.  I also didn't need to broil, the bacon was done perfectly for us without broiling. The cheese mixture (which made more then 3 tablespoons for each breast) wanted to squeeze out of the breast during rolling but I managed with the help of several toothpicks. Somewhat messy to prepare but we both loved these breasts served with Thai rice and a veggie. We could only eat 1 each for dinner so I still have 10 in the freezer for future meals. That makes me deliriously happy so thanks for posting this.",2008-12-06

Note: I found that if I hide it behind the low cal ice cream he doesn't see it. LOL",2008-12-20
79944,588049,5,1,"I just ate this for dinner, and I must say I was very pleased.  I used chicken tenders and applied dollops of cream cheese along the tops and then wrapped the bacon around it.  I don't know if the butter was really necessary because the bacon provided plenty of grease.  We won't have enough left to freeze - my husband gobbled all of it up except for one piece!  It's very rich, and tastes like it's a lot more complicated to make.  Thank you for sharing such a lovely recipe!",2008-12-28
79944,489552,5,1,"This was delicious !!  I made a tray of about 10 good size chicken pieces and there is no left overs.  My girls immediately asked me to make this again soon.

Either way, I will make this again.  Also, it's super fast and easy to make. I served with mashed potatoes, broccoli and crescent rolls. Thanks!",2009-02-21
79944,42217,5,1,This was delicious!  I was very surprised how moist the chicken was.  I did not add the salt; didn't need it with the bacon.  Also took another reviewers advice and added sliced mushrooms and turned it half-way through.  Might cook for 30 minutes next time and then broil for crispier bacon.  Wonderful and a keeper!  Thank you!,2009-02-27

79944,227607,5,1,"Oh WOW!!! This was wonderful.  I used some chicken breasts from a bag I had and did not pound them out.  They were thinner pieces anyway.  I just put some of the cream cheese mixture(I used regular cream cheese and mixed in dried onion, lots of garlic, and pepper) on the top then wrapped bacon around the whole pieces. I left the butter out and just sprayed the foil with butter flavored pam. I also did not need to broil them at the end because the bacon was already crispy.  My whole family LOVED this.  The kids who usually only eat a tiny bit of chicken each ate a whole piece and part of another.",2009-03-20

79944,169609,5,1,I love this and so does my boyfriend.  I use the low fat cream cheese and add chives to it separately becase BF doesn't like them.  I also salt & pepper the chicken (both sides) before I put in the cream cheese to give it extra seasoning. I've made this lots of times...how can you go wrong with cream cheese and bacon??!!!,2009-04-04
79944,1188656,4,1,Yummy Yummy great flavor think I'll keep this one handy for OAMC at least once a month.,2009-04-04
79944,653506,5,1,"So VERY easy and delicious!!! Next time I think I will wrap it both ways so all the cream cheese doesn't spill out of the sides, but it was still fabulous at that. Also, I used 2 pieces of bacon per breast...Thank you for the great chicken recipe!",2009-04-23
79944,1040507,5,1,"Oh my!  We loved these!  I skipped the butter.  I didn't have the flavored cream  cheese, so I chopped a bunch of fresh chives and mixed them with a cube of cream cheese.

79944,1102585,4,1,liked by the whole family even my picky 5 year old.  it was almost to easy to turn out so well.  next time im going to use plain cream cheese with jalepenos to spice it up.  thanks,2009-10-08

79944,1052055,4,1,"These were soft but I wasn't too thrilled about the taste. I used garlic and herb laughing cow wedges and even added some adobo. It still seemed to lack flavor, possibly due to my own taste preferences. But the kids loved it. :) thanks. I think next time I will definitely use cream cheese but will add different spices or some bbq flavor to spice it up a bit.",2009-10-10
79944,714956,5,1,"WOW! I would give 10 stars if I could, this is the best chicken recipe by far! I didnt have any problem with the cream cheese spilling out at all, and I only used 1 piece of bacon per chicken half and it was enough. I was not sure what exactly a breast half was but since a breast is a lot of food I flattened it out then cut it in half assuming thats what the recipe meant, it worked out well this way. I didnt change a thing about the recipe and it doesnt need any changes. Thank you for such a great recipe, I will for sure be making this again!

Ok, we had this again last night only I used leftovers of Recipe #326343 as the filling this time. If you like jalepenos and cream cheese you will like it using this as a filling. We really enjoyed it the other way and this way, although totally different flavor, we LOVED even more! It is a bit spicy but not overkill. (I am not a huge fan of hot things) We will be having it both ways now to change it up a bit.",2009-06-24

79944,1291672,5,1,This chicken was very good and soo easy to prepare!  I cut the bacon strips in half and layered them on top of the chicken.  They crisped up nicely.  My boyfriend ate three pieces of chicken because he said they were sooo good!  Thanks for a great recipe!,2009-08-03
79944,237624,5,1,"YUM!!!!!  beyond easy, very delicious, perrrrfect for any time of year.  i placed the cream cheese on top of chicken breasts and wrapped with bacon.  they took a little longer to cook, but that could have been the oven (wasn't my oven so i'm not familiar with how it normally behaves).  will definitely make again!",2009-08-08

DH & DD loved it but agreed that it was a little dry.
I think next time I will cook at 400 then lower after a few minutes to 300 , cover and bake a while longer than stated.

Maybe a nice basting of butter or use 2 slices of bacon instead of one.
EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH BUTTER OR BACON ON IT!

I don't think it hurt a thing.  I also used much less cream cheese-just spread a light layer over the chicken.  One pc. of bacon didn't seem to cover the breasts I had so I used 2 pcs. on each breast.  Everyone loved it.  I made my pc. without the bacon but tasted the one with bacon-I would throw caution to the wind on this one and eat the bacon too.  Although it tasted good without it, it tasted GREAT with it!

79944,46357,5,1,"YUM! This went over very well with DH and 5 year old. It's very easy and delicious. Will definitely make again.

UPDATE: I have made this several times, including tonight. I now calculate the WW pts, which is only 6 if you use 4 oz chix breasts, light cream cheese and 1 slice bacon each.",2009-09-24
79944,654921,5,1,"I made this tonight and agree it was delicious. I also agree with a few other reviewers that it's probably best to either flip the chicken half way through, or cut the bacon in half and lay it on top to make sure it gets cooked thoroughly. Mine was uncooked on the bottom and I prefer crispy bacon. Delicious, easy dish!",2009-09-24
79944,1344900,5,1,"This is a keeper. Thanks Trish for the great recipe. All I had on hand were bonless chicken thighs but decided to try the recipe anyway and I also slightly pre-cooked the bacon to by baking in the oven on a rack to remove some of the fat. Worked great and I didn't have to place them under the broiler to brown the bacon. Now I plan to try it with the breasts to see which one the family likes best. Also  plan on making a  batch to freeze. Thanks again for a great recipe.

79944,447831,5,1,SOO easy! I did put the bacon ON TOP only as suggested...and sprinkled garlic salt on the insides before rolling.  I also used thick cut pepper bacon which added a TON of flavor! Soo easy and good!,2009-09-28
79944,533395,5,1,These smelt amazing as they came out from under the grill.  I followed the recipe excatly. The only trouble i had was cutting the large chicken breasts in half.  Next time i'll buy smaller ones and not cut them.  I also took advice from another review and cooked them first and then froze.  Many thanks.,2009-10-12
79944,779123,5,1,This meal was so delicious!  I brushed some butter and garlic over these while the cooked.  YUM!!  Thanks for the recipe!  This is a big keeper!,2009-10-12

I took the grease from the bacon and added it in the water of the green beans I was cooking. It gave the green beans a nice flavor.",2009-11-16
79944,404043,5,1,"Indeed this was a wonderful recipe! The flavors went together quite well. The crispness of the bacon with the soft cream cheese center also made a really nice texture to the chicken.
A note for people who are as ignorant as I am....prepare all that you are going to fix in bowl or on plates. I realized halfway through preparation of this wonderful dish that I was touching poultry, bacon, cream cheese and butter all together. Not of course with the same utensil but, the utensil that was used for each ingredient still may have touched the raw poultry. So, I had to throw out the leftover ingredients that made this chicken dish so tasty. Word from the wise...do like the chefs do on television..have all the ingredients ready to go prior to preparing the chicken..separately with a utensil for each of course.. 
Thank you Tish, for sharing a delicious recipe!",2009-11-21

I forgot to add the salt, and I used 2 slices of bacon per breast.  I'll definitely make this again...even DH, though it wasn't a huge hit with him, said I could add it to the regular rotation.

Next time I'm going to try turkey bacon and plain cream cheese infused with minced garlic, onion and cilantro.  
Thanks Tish!  :)
******3/15/10******
Update:  I made these a couple of weeks ago and forgot to post.  I used the turkey bacon, and plain cream cheese, (in the tub) that I softened and then added 2 cloves garlic, grated fine, onion powder, (only because my onion went bad. :(  ) and about 1-2 TBS fresh cilantro, chopped.  I mixed it about 6-8 hours in advance of making them and it was awesome!  The turkey bacon did much better than I had expected.  Of course it's not real bacon, but it came out nice and well done esp after a blast on broil for about 2 minutes plus/minus.  The cream cheese had the garlic, onion cilantro flavors we love, but the amounts I gave is to our taste.  You may like more or less, so adjust.  I want to do it again with fresh onion, and a smidge of cumin w/a dash of cayenne just to see what happens.  Hubby and I love the southwest/Mexican flavors so we lean to those spices in alot of recipes.  Will let you know!  :-)",2010-03-16
79944,542900,3,0,Giving 3 stars but it is my fault. The flavor was good but I like bacon crisp (with breakfast) so I totally dried it out. I will make again and settle for less crisp bacon. I had such hi hopes for this but I messed it up by drying it out so much!!! Will review again when I make again...,2010-03-18

79944,1244621,3,0,I was super excited to try this recipe based on the great reviews but we unfortunately did not like it.  I guess for us the taste of the bacon overpowered the chicken and the cream cheese was not to our liking.  Maybe if we partially cooked the bacon to rid it of some of the grease that would help with the bacon flavor not killing the taste of the chicken.,2010-04-29
79944,1611975,3,0,This was just ok.  Probably won't make it again.,2010-06-14
79944,120264,4,1,I enjoyed making this dish.  Hubby liked this more that I did.  Thanks for posting,2010-07-10
79944,352814,4,1,"We all liked this recipe.  Instead of wrapping the bacon around the chicken, I cut it into thirds and layered it on top.  Broiling at the end helps crisp the bacon up.  I have made this several times, but we have always eaten it for dinner and I haven't had a chance to freeze any yet, so I can't comment on how well they work as a make ahead meal.  Thanks for the recipe!",2010-07-13

Based on all the reviews that people have left on here, I did change a few things.  I only made five pieces of chicken instead of twelve.<br/><br/>I salted the chicken before putting the cream cheese on it.  I only bought 1 container of onion and chive cream cheese, which was plenty.  I also bought a package of thick sliced bacon and wrapped each chicken in 3 strips of it.  (YUM!)  <br/><br/>I cooked these for half the time on 400 degrees and the other half at 300 degrees.  I also turned the chicken over during the broil to get both sides crispy.  It was amazing!

Fixed 2 of the smaller ones for dinner and was amazed that the cheese didn't all melt away !  Very tasrt-- did the 400* to 325*, and they were nicely done and moist in 40 minutes.

Next, placed the brown sugar in the oven and let it dry out for about 1 1/2 hours. Used a spice grinder. Worked perfectly!

213555,278516,5,1,"Hey, there's nothing wrong with a warm salad when it tastes this good!! So colourful & smells fantastic.
I used 1/2 ea large red & green capsicum, 1/2 an onion, but left all the other measurements the same. I used tuna canned with tomato & caramelized onion. I was a little worried how the flavour would work with the lemon & mayo, but it was like they were always *meant* to be together!
I steamed the peas & left them sitting in the saucepan & completely forgot about them until I'd finished dinner & taken my bowl back to the kitchen! Not overly fussed on peas anyway, so i wont bother with them next time.

310518,605921,5,1,"Excellent! Very tasty! However, I would eliminate the salt, minimize or eliminate the onions (overpowering) and make sure the crumbs are finely crushed, not clumpy. This would allow for more even distribution of the sauce.
Tasted great anyway. Can't wait to try it again with some minor fine tuning. Upon DH's first bite, I heard, ""Mmmmm...""",2008-12-28
310518,146047,4,1,"I love the flavors in this dish and it was very easy to put together. Unfortunately, the breading got soggy because of the sherry, despite the last minute broiling. Next time what I would do is simply dip the fish in sherry before breading, and then eliminate the sherry from the butter/onion/garlic mixture. I think this way you could retain the great flavors and have a nice browned, crispy top. Thanks for posting!",2008-12-31

I cooked the ingredients in a microwave, and put a few spoonfuls into quart-size zip-top bags along with the popcorn. (The bag was about half-full of popcorn in order to have room to shake it.)   Then, each participant shook their bag to mix their own popcorn & get it coated with the peanut butter mixture.  Everyone loved it.  I'll be making this again soon- thanks for sharing!",2007-01-20

Instead of water and boullion, used four cups chicken stock. Added cornstarch to some of the stock, to thicken.  Next time, will add chunks of onion and sweet potato.  Husband added more cayenne and curry at the table; he is more highly evolved than I am.  Used organic peanut butter (no additives) so threw in a scant teaspoon of sugar to compensate.  Reduced the butter/oil amounts, also.  I really didn't totally re-do the recipe, but am leaving all these notes because I will certainly make this again.

I made it Exactly as directed,  and DH said on Saturday,  maybe it was a little salty (I normally cook with no salt, or next to none).  On Sunday I put it into a casserole dish,   added about another half cup of water and warmed it slowly in the oven  as I prepared side dishes.   It looked perfect before I did that,  the extra water just helped it to still have a thick sauce without drying out.    I prepared rice to go with the chicken, a slightly spicy rice,  and the whole dish was very well received,   the little that was left over (I made a lot of other dishes too!), my DH had for lunch today,  he declared it excellent and I will make it again.

Putting it in the crock pot to simmer & keep hot for the guys gave the flavors a chance to develop.  It turned out to be very well liked.  A  nice alternative to tomato based sloppy joes, which I will not eat.  Thanks for sharing!  Adopted for PAC Spring 2008.",2008-05-17
284928,60992,4,1,"A very interesting twist to the old sloppy joe! It really needs some salt & pepper to perk it up some. I was amazed at how subtle the flavor was especially using steak sauce which can be quite strong in flavor. Nothing in this overpowers anything at all. My husband really enjoyed this sandwich, and said to make it again. I am hoping like a good chili or spaghetti sauce the flavors will deepen upon standing. This is incredibily easy  and goes together quickly. Cut a few veggies up and throw some chips on the table and you have a meal before you know it!",2010-01-01

Great taste, and the lasagna held together very nicely for a nice presentation when dished up.

I'll make it again with a different sauce next time as, apart from the sloppiness, it was delicious and the flavours worked well.

I baked mine in a casserole dish for 55 mins and kept it covered with aluminum foil for the first 40 mins so that the cheese wouldn't burn. I used less spaghetti sauce (about 36 oz). I added a handful of fresh basil to the sauce, along with some chopped onions, fresh minced garlic and 1/2 lb ground beef. I used canned spinach and I thought it worked great. I sauteed the mushrooms and zucchini before adding it to the lasagna, but I added the zucchini during the last 2 mins so that they wouldn't get overcooked and mushy when cooked in the lasagna. For the cheese I used 2 cups of shredded mozzarella and 1 cup of fresh mozzarella. I followed some of the reviews and didn't cook the lasagna first. I was somewhat nervous about doing it that way but it turned out perfect and I won't cook it from now on because it's so much easier to add it uncooked. My lasagna barely fit in the pan. I was worried that it might overflow but it didn't. Next time I'd like to add 1 lb of ground beef instead of 1/2 lb. We liked the addition of ground beef but would have liked more of it, so next time I will add 1 lb of it and decrease some of the other ingredients. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used 2  (26 oz.) cans of Hunts No Sugar Added Italian Style Sauce, which gives you 4 more oz. of sauce, and just added a little more (Italian Seasoning in place of the oregano).  I put down half the sauce, then the noodles (I used whole wheat), then the FF Ricotta  spinach mixture, so it would be easier to spread, then more sauce, half the zucchini, all the mushrooms, then the rest of the sauce, then the rest of the cheeses, leaving me with about 1 c. of the Ricotta cheese and spinach mixture, 3 noodles, and half the zucchini left over.  I couldn't fit it in the 9x13"" pan.  Next time I will make it in a larger pan so I can add all the rest of the stuff in to make more layers.

I added 1 small onion; chopped and 1 garlic; minced added both of these to the mushrooms, that I then browned first (any excess liquid from the mushrooms I drained first before adding as a layer). Also I used fresh lasagna noodles that you find in the refrigerator section in the grocery store's deli.

14684,850974,5,1,"Mmmmmmmm.... while I do think the yummy factor depends on the yummyness of your sauce, this is a GREAT lasagna! Like others I cooked my mushrooms and drained their liquid before using them. I also ommitted the parm mostly because I didn't feel like grating any, and I had extra mozz. I also had some left over tempeh from the previous nights dinner, which I steamed, mashed with a fork and then added to the sauce, carrots, and oregano. I then heated this sauce to let the tempeh absorb the sauce flavors. I don't even notice it, or the carrots for that matter. Used a whole box of whole wheat lasagna noodles (makes a very full pan) I cooked the pasta for about 4 minutes and then used them which was a good idea because the noodles weren't mushy or uncooked, but perfectly al dente, surprisingly enough, because the dish itself was a little soupy...

I think next time I will use a little more ricotta, just b/c I like it and it makes it fluffier! I also made my own marinara a day ahead time.  It tastes really good if you have a good sauce! He said it was very fresh tasting and light.  I used a little less cheese also!",2011-05-09
14684,937635,5,1,"Wonderful lasagna! I forgot to buy carrots, so I added extra mushrooms for the veggie-power. I was nervous to put the noodles in without cooking as other reviewres suggested and I cooked a box of lasagna noodles instead of 6 accidentally, so I made an extra layer (same amount of other ingredients). Mine came out very watery and I'm not sure if it was because of the extra  layer, but next time I will definitely skip the boiling to see if the lasagna firms up. I used Roundy's specialty roasted garlic pasta sauce. The taste was PERFECT! Thanks for the awesome veg recipe!<br/><br/>Update: I made this without pre-cooking the noodles and the bottom layer worked well, but the edges around the top didn't fully cook (no one noticed or said anything tho). The whole dish wasn't nearly as watery which was great. I might soak half the noodles for the top layer in warm water next time while I prep.",2011-06-12

I doubled Kittencal's Marinara Pasta Sauce (http://www.food.com/recipe/kittencals-marinara-pasta-sauce-vegetarian-136292) for the sauce, and it was fantastic. And for the lasagna, I split this recipe into two 8""x8"" pans. The BIGGEST NECESSITY for this recipe is to drain and blot ALL of your veggies very, very well to soak up ALL extra moisture! I also sauteed the mushrooms in a bit of olive oil to reduce them down before I used them, and I ended up using 16 oz of mushrooms total. I also doubled the amount of carrot required for more filling. I then changed up the layers: (Bottom to top) thin layer sauce, noodles, thin layer sauce, ricotta mixture, parmesan, zucchini, mushrooms, mozzarella, sauce, noodles, thin layer sauce, ricotta mixture, parmesan, zucchini, mushrooms, sauce, and mozzarella on top. I baked this at 350 for 20 minutes covered with foil (sprayed with oil to prevent sticking) and then 25 minutes uncovered. The cheese on top came out perfectly bubbly.

Didn't think my husband would like it, due to the additional carrots in the sauce, but even I couldn't tell they were in there!  The mushrooms worked excellently as meat substitutions.  Only had fresh spinach on hand and used that, but aside from that I followed the recipe exactly.  I used Dreamfields low gluten lasagna noodles and Mezzetta's Arrabbiata sauce (our favorite).  It's important to use a sauce you love because is definitely the ""star"" of the show.  My husband had two large servings and ""mmmMmmm'd"" after every other  bite.  This recipe is definitely a keeper, and one that can be easily memorized!",2012-07-19

Even my picky 7 year old son ate two helpings of it.  I made my own sauce from scratch and used uncooked wheat noodles.  I also cut the mushrooms into smaller pieces and saut&eacute;ed with them a little olive oil and garlic.  I put the saut&eacute;ed mushrooms on a paper towel while I prepared the other items to ensure there was not too much liquid.  I also squeezed out the liquid from the spinach with paper towels.  Everything else was identical to what the recipe called for.  I didn?t measure the amount of sauce on each layer, just put on what I typically do for my usual lasagna.  Once it was all assembled I covered it with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge.  Monday night my 16 year old son took it out of the fridge, put aluminum foil on top and we cooked it until the cheese looked melted and bubbly.  I was shocked when the noodles were perfectly cooked AND the lasagna was not runny in the least bit.  I was hugely impressed with the recipe and everyone in the family stated they would definitely eat it again.  My 16 year old even said he didn?t even realize there was no meat in it.  Any recipe that can impress my husband and all three of my kids is a keeper without a doubt!  I love the fact that my kids eat so many veggies in just a single serving.",2013-04-16

This vegetable lasagna was a hit!  Our daughter and her friend had 3 servings!  I chopped and heated fresh spinach that I had on  hand, didn&#039;t measure.  I simply eyeballed and added it to the ricotta mixture until I was happy with the consistency. I also used no bake lasagna noodles making sure that the noodles were completely covered with sauce.  I then covered the pans with foil for 40 minutes, and uncovered them for the last 10 minutes.  Voila!  

I didn&#039;t have a 9X13 pan so I used (2) smaller 8X11 pans that I had on hand.  The measurements of this recipe allowed me to make 2 small pans of 2 layered lasagna.  Delish!    THANKS MILES! :)",2015-02-28

Last, I used no bake noodles and, after assembling my lasagna, I covered it and put in the fridge overnight as another reviewer suggested.

The other change up was using Creamette &quot;oven ready&quot; lasagna....no need to boil... came out perfectly and saved some time.  I also put in a little extra effort making sure that the spinach was as well drained as possible... The result was that this casserole stood up well and was not runny at all!

14684,2000490943,4,1,"I made this the other night and it came out great considering I&#039;ve never made a lasagna before ...I used no-boil lasagna noodles, skim ricotta, Boves jarred tomato/basil sauce, fresh mushrooms that I saut&eacute;ed in olive oil &amp; minced garlic, fresh mozzrrella, and thawed spinach. No carrots as I&#039;m not a big fan. I followed the baking instructions on the back of the lasagna box  and covered it with sprayed foil to prevent sticking, and baked it in the oven for about an hour. It came out a little watery at the bottom, so next time I&#039;m going to make sure I dry the spinach and mushrooms thoroughly! Another thing I would do differently next time is I would lightly salt the veggies. I would use fresh sauteed spinach vs. the frozen/thawed kind... frozen spinach retained a lot of water. It was borderline impossible to dry, tasted funky, and was VERY stemmy(I hate spinach stems, Ill spend one hour de-stemming fresh spinach, Im crazy like that). It kind of over-powered the ricotta, which where I used the skim kind it was a little bland to begin with. All in all a great recipe and I will make it again!",2015-09-22

I roasted the sliced zuchini and the carrots with olive oil and salt before layering them. I also sauteed the mushrooms to remove excess water and add flavor. I added salt and pepper and a little parsley and basil to the cheese mixture and used some of the mozzarella as well. I think next time I will add asiago to the cheesy nonsense on top, but overall, this is the best veggie lasagna I have ever had.

In his words, &quot;you could serve this in a 5 star restaurant and receive critical acclaim?&quot;. That is huge, as my family usually tries to be nice when I attempt to cook something by at least finishing half their portion. This time, they each had 2 servings.

However, I have made a third and still have at least 32 oz of spaghetti sauce and a good amount of ricotta left over. I used two 9 x the 11 x 2.25&quot; lasagna pans. The depth of the pan wasn't mentioned in the recipe. Is there a deeper one I should have used? After making the 3 lasagna I even have a 32oz bag of mozzarella I never opened. Any helpful ideas/thoughts would be greatly appreciated as I really like this dish but can't figure out the proper proportions. UPDATE: I had the link to this recipe saved in my phone. What I failed to remember was that before I saved it I had already doubled everything. I wound up quadrupling the recipe. Operator error. Mia culpa. Mia culpa.

14684,2001052678,5,1,"This was a great recipe! I did follow Birdinhand's suggestions and I browned a small onion and then added the mushrooms to the saute pan and saute'ed them with the onions, as well. I added the minced garlic to the sauce along with the oregano. Then I remembered that the flavor I associate with &quot;lasagna&quot; is fennel, and I added about a half teaspoon of ground fennel to the sauce, too. Oh, did that make the difference! My box of whole wheat pasta had 8 lasagna noodles and I used them all, so I had a couple of noodles going perpendicular to the rest at the bottom of my casserole dish. I had two cups of zucchini, so I cut back the spinach to one 10 oz box and kept the sauce to one quart since zucchini is so juicy. I do not like a sloppy lasagna. I also ended up with about a cup of carrots when I grated two of them, and used it all. I also used all of my two packages of mozzarella, which was four cups. I probably used about a cup of grated parm, too. I probably don't need to point this out by now, but just in case this is the first of its reviews you are reading, this recipe is very flexible! Throw in whatever vegetables you like, but don't let them be too wet. Make sure they will cook through in the baking, or prepare them by sauteing them first.",2016-06-17

I followed the directions exactly, except I added 1/2 cup of diced onion.   It was even better the next day for lunch.  Next time I may add a bit more sauce, but that is a personal preferance.  Thanks so much for sharing an  excellent recipe!  :)",2003-06-04
32548,22655,5,1,"Okay, this is the best lasagna I have ever pulled off! I skipped the sausage and used all ground beef, added a little chopped onion and more spices-EXCELLENT! I personally think the fresh parsley added so much. This is one for the recipe books. In fact, I am going to make two pans for company this weekend. Oh-I did use the no-boil noodles-perfect. Leftovers tonight!
Thanks!",2003-08-11
32548,107144,4,1,I'm surprised no-one mentioned the omission of water?? I thought the sauce was way too thick when it was simmering...added about 1 cup water. I also added the italian ssng to the the ricotta mixture. End results still could have had more though. My problem is....I'm trying to find a lasagna that I had when I was a kid at my parents friends house.Haven't found it yet...but I still give this one 4 stars. Thanx.,2003-10-12
32548,75191,5,1,"My kids didnt think I could make lasanga like my ex-wife. WRONG. This was a very full flavored recipe. I used bulk Italian sausage
instead of the pork and did add water to the sauce as it was simmering. I simmered the sauce 2 hours and it made the house smell great. One last thing. I added some red pepper flake for a little bite. Thanks for a great recipe.",2003-11-02
32548,117781,5,1,"I wish I could rate this 4.5 stars, because really it was ALMOST perfect. The sauce  consistency was perfect, but a tad too sweet so I will decrease to 1 tsp of sugar next time. The great thing about this is that it IS a thick sauce with the sausage (I used mild Italian) and ground beef and that makes this set up and slice beautifully. Believe me, there is plenty of sauce, it just isn't overly saucy - which is a good thing!  I found the cottage cheese mixture to be a little too watery, maybe it was the brand that I used but it was a little eggy as well.  I will decrease to 2 eggs and I will use more ricotta and less cottage cheese the next go 'round. I also will grate about 1/2 cup more mozzarella because the top layer was not quite cheesy enough for us.  I think those are very minor details that would be done just to suit my particular family's taste.  Also, I did not simmer the sauce for 1 hour. I only simmered it for about 25 minutes and it was still excellent. Overall, one of the best lasagnas I have made and it was even better the next day!! Thank you for sharing!",2004-04-28
32548,88732,5,1,"I made this and divided it into two 8x8 pans.  One for now and one later. I thought the meat sauce was very easy to make.  Not alot of crazy ingredients.  I enjoyed simmering it on the stove and smelling the aroma.  I was at school, last night, when the family ate it.  This morning, I asked my teen age girls what they thought of it, and they said ""Oh, it was REALLY good""  ""It was really cheesy""
""I thought there was just the right amount of tomato sauce"" So, there you have it.
Make some for your family tonight!",2004-11-10
32548,227039,5,1,"EXCEPTIONAL Lasagna recipe!!!
    I followed your recipe with a few minor adjustments due to our extra huge lasagna pan and plus make another pan for my mother-inlaw & sis-inlaw and to fit our taste,,We used hamburg and sweet italian sausage,used 2-28 ounce cans crushed tomatoes and 2-28 ounce cans tomato puree and 2 cans tomato paste,2 tsps of sugar,4 heaping TBl spoons of minced garlic from jar,some chopped onions,doubled up on the spices and herbs,used fresh parsley and basil.simmered sauce for 2 hrs adding 1-1/2 cups of chicken broth when sauce was looking a bit too thick.
    We used all ricotta instead of cottage cheese,less mottz using it only a tad in the filling mixture with the fresh grated parm and some more mottz on the top,added some swiss cheese along with the provolone slices layer.
   This was the first time my lasagna actually stood up and sliced perfectly,we thought it came out beautifully and extremely delicious!!!      Your recipe Rocks out loud!!!
   I will be using this recipe from now on!!!!

32548,37779,5,1,"All in my family agreed--this lasagna was excellent. I have never used bulk pork sausage in the meat sauce (usually use Italian sausage) but I thought the flavor was quite good. The meat sauce was plenty thick which  helped keep the layers from smooshing out when I sliced it. The five cheeses is what, IMO, sets this one apart from all the rest. It makes for a very rich, luscious lasagna. This freezes and reheats quite well so would be good for OAMC. Thank you for posting a great recipe.",2007-01-16
32548,52262,5,1,Delicious and easy to make!  I used 1 3/4 pounds ground beef instead of using pork sausage.  I used lower fat cottage cheese and ricotta cheese.  I also used about 22 ounces of tomato sauce.  I thought the meat sauce was a little too thick.  I let the sauce simmer for about 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes.,2007-02-16

I can't wait to eat the leftovers for dinner tonight!! Thanks again, Anne",2008-02-04
32548,243089,5,1,"This was really a great lasagna (I really mean it, please see how I rate)! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but made a few changes just to make it easy working with quantities: used entire container of cottage cheese (16 oz, which was about two cups when measured), 15 oz container ricotta (to make up for the missing cup of cottage - it worked out well), and 1 lb bulk Italian pork sausage (that is how it was packaged, it turned out to be a little bit too much and I will decrease this amount to what the recipe suggests next time).  The dish was full when layered with tasty goodness and the final layer of mozzarella stuck to the aluminum foil.  I might try sprinkling the mozzarella after uncovering, for the last 20 minutes of baking (this is just for looks, the flavor was outstanding anyways).  Thank you for sharing.",2008-05-11
32548,958968,5,1,"Wow!  This was my first attempt at homemade lasagna.  The recipe was very easy to follow and much simpler than I thought ""real"" lasagna could be.  I made the meat sauce the night before, assembled the lasagna in the morning, and popped it in the oven after work.  I used Happy Hobbits quanities for the ricotta and cottage cheese to accomodate for the sizes sold in my grocery store and I used Barilla no boil lasagna noodles.  My husband enjoyed the sauce so much, I will be making it for the lasagna and also on its own with pasta when I'm crunched for time.  Great recipe!!!",2008-09-28
32548,674484,4,1,"I only added 1 tsp. sugar, so it wouldn't be too sweet, and I used 1 lb. of hot sausage instead of 3/4 lb., and no onion?  What's up with that?  I added 1 big one in with the sauce. I increased the italian seasoning to 2 tsp. to give it some flavor, and then let the sauce simmer for 2 hours.  You want to give the sauce enough time for the flavors to blend together.  Then I made the lasagna. When it was done, I brought it into work, and we had a feast at lunch break.  Everyone came running in to grab a piece.  Got lots of compliments on it with the changes.  Good basic recipe, but for us seasoned cooks we know when something needs a little tweaking, and this one did, no matter if it won a contest or not :)",2008-10-10
32548,1113712,5,1,"My husband who works for a major food company and used to mass produce lasagna liked this recipe.  He knows lasagna inside and out.  He said this recipe is good because it's not runny and has a nice taste.  So if he says it's good that means it's really, really good to us normal people.  I enjoyed making it.  It was nice to have time to prepare the rest of the recipe while the meat sauce cooked for an hour.  I didn't have to rush around the kitchen.  I'm looking forward to making it again.  Thanks for posting the recipe.",2009-01-11
32548,709541,5,1,"This lasagna was awesome!  The sausage gave it such a great flavor.  I didn't add the sugar to the sauce, as I don't like sweet sauce.  I just made it without.  I loved the flavor of the combination of cheeses that you used and we all give it a high five!",2009-02-14
32548,422040,5,1,"The best lasagna I've ever made.  I usually substitute more ground beef for the sausage (wife preference) and double the ricotta, cutting down on the cottage cheese.",2009-03-01
32548,297761,5,1,"I don't eat lasagna much (even though I come from an Italian family) and I've never made it before, but I thought this was wonderful and so did my family and my 12 dinner guests. The sauce could stand alone with some nice rotini. I added 1 more clove of garlic and think it could have even handled more, and I never add sugar until the last, cause I tend to like my sauces a little more tart and maybe it won't need to be sweeter. I did have to add some diluted tomato juice to thin it out so I could simmer it longer. The only thing I would do differently next time is keep the sauce slightly thinner cause I used the Barilla no-cook lasagna noodles and I think they absorbed more moisture and I think the sauce could have been a little thinner after cooking. This is a keeper recipe and my family is already dying for me to make it again. It wasn't that much work with the no-cook noodles. I served it with an Olive Garden copy cat salad (I bought the dressing - it was so much easier). Thanks for a great recipe!",2009-03-14

32548,807941,4,1,Great tasting but I found it a little dry and not nearly enough meat sauce (although some of the guests thought the consistency was perfect).  Personally I like my lasagna a little more soupy so next time I'll increase the amount of sauce I make.  I'll add a little extra sauce to the lasagna itself and reserve the rest of the extra sauce so the people who like their lasagna soupy can ladle a few spoonfuls over their chunk.,2010-04-05
32548,1005123,5,1,So good!  My husband and his best friend ate half of it in one sitting!  They said it was the best lasagna they'd ever had!  The consistency was perfect!  I used italian turkey sausage instead of pork and they loved that it is super meaty.  Thanks for a great recipe!,2010-07-28
32548,1700732,5,1,"This recipe was wonderful. I think the sauce made a huge difference. The lasagna layered perfectly and was not soupy at all. I think we have all had lasagna that was either too dry or way too soupy. This lasagna was neither. It hit it right on the mark. I mean it when I say the sauce made the difference. It was thick and held up nicely and was also flavorful and sweet. I added a little more garlic (4 cloves instead of two). This was just out of personal preference. This dish was very much enjoyed by my family. My Mother said it was the best lasagna she has ever tasted and my Brother had seconds. My Dad, who is known for putting ketchup on everything, refrained from adding ketchup to this meal. You know you've done well when he goes without ketchup. I'm definitely going to share this recipe with my colleagues, and will most likely make this the next time I have dinner with my soccer team. <br/><br/><br/>This recipe is a winner!",2010-10-09

32548,593513,5,1,"I love lasagna and love trying different recipes sometimes from my own....and this one did not let me down...It was absolutely delicious !!! I didn't do too much different than how the recipe is written. I did use an extra clove of garlic and a small chopped onion. I had sauteed them along with the meats. And as another reviewer had done, I had used 16oz Cottage Cheese and 15oz Ricotta. This just makes it so there is no little bits of leftovers of those cheeses. Plus I used 5 cups of the mozzarella...only because I love cheese and it didn't seem enough with just 1 cup on top. And I only had 15 oz cans of tomato sauces so I had used 2 for a total of 30 oz instead of 24 oz. I found I had to put on a cover lightly over the sauce while it was simmering because it was spitting all over the place. (ouch)  The flavors were so great together and made this a fantastic lasagna. We were only two for lunch but I always freeze the rest in portions for 2 people and they always turn out fantastic when reheated.<br/>I didn't finish my review and it got submitted ..while I was still typing and wouldn't let me back in to finish.....grrrr.....

32548,1012370,5,1,"Outstanding!  I have made this several times, each time to rave reviews.  I only made a couple of minor changes, as others suggested; sauteed onion and garlic first, then added the meat.  I also used more mozzarella, but that's a personal preference.",2011-03-22

That evening I boiled the noodles, put everything together and put it back into the fridge. The next day I let the lasagna sit out for about 45 minutes and then cooked as directed. Delicious!

32548,2000811883,3,0,"My husband &amp; I were disappointed. Traditional Lasagna does not have cottage cheese in it, &amp; it made it have some liquid pockets. No provolone either. A very mediocre recipe.",2016-01-10
32548,2000604934,5,1,"This is a great recipe.  The provolone is a wonderful addition that I&#039;ve never seen before.  I did make a few changes of my own that I thought added to the flavor for those with the ingredients and inclination.  First, my family are garlic lovers so I increased the amount to 5 cloves (fresh).  We also love onion so I added a small yellow one.  I had some fresh basil and oregano left over from a prior recipe so I added about a teaspoon of each of those.  I couldn&#039;t find ricotta in an 8 oz. portion and didn&#039;t want to waste any so I used 16 oz. of that and 16 oz. of cottage cheese.  Occasionally I also add 4 or 5 finely chopped button mushrooms just for something different.  I&#039;m way lazy when it comes to the noodles and always use &quot;oven ready.&quot;  I can&#039;t tell a difference.  And one last thing for anyone who uses &quot;preground&quot; pepper - freshly ground is much more pungent and can really make or break a dish although sometimes you&#039;ll need to use less to avoid the burn.   Again, a fantastic recipe, I just like to experiment and hope others might find the ideas useful.",2016-03-29

Plus, making this type of pie from scratch takes me forever because cherries are so labor intensive. I had to bake this longer than indicated, and even after resting for hours it was way too loose. It was also a bit sweet for me. Heating it up and melting a big scoop of vanilla ice cream over it added to the enjoyment and cut the sweetness. If I made this again, I would thicken the filling more and maybe use less sugar due to the pie filling.

ETA:  Ok, so this is a completely different pie after a day in the fridge.  The sweetness really mellowed out and it held up far better.  It was kind of like a cold version of a McDonalds cherry pie with berries.",2008-04-06

The 1/4 cup of wine had evaporated in less than 25 minutes at a simmer and I scorched the chops a bit but added water just in time.

One thing I would change would be the noodles they really need to be Chow Mein style, Yakisoba noddles work as well. I am pretty sure Panda express fries their noodles or uses noodles that have been previously fried. When making the noodles I have found that cooking them lightly works best. Then you finish cooking them in the mixture.  I also put less sugar than what they call for. I have also had to double the sauce they call for on the rest of the ingredients. I do not own a wok but that is the best way to cook it right. The veggies should be lightly cooked( to simulate this using a frying pan add the longer cooking veggies first cook with half of the sauce. add all veggies until they are all lightly cooked but not soft(still slightly crunchy). Remove from heat. Refry the noodles separate with sauce then add it all the the mixture and serve. These are my suggestions. Oh also you should not use toasted sesame oil. it has a distinct flavor not found in their Chow Mein. I saw another Panda recipe that called for un-toasted Sesame oil and  Vegetable mixed( that is more accurate I think).

Panda is a chow mein, it has been fried before which makes it NOT mooshy and appealing. Gotta buy the chinese chow mein in a local chinese market it usually is prepackaged fresh then you boil it for a few minutes.

It didn&#039;t say to vent the top crust, but I did. I also used and egg wash over the top.

I saved off the vegetables from it, and ate them as a side.  They were great.   I have some leftover liquid from the simmering; I will use that tomorrow as a soup base.  Maybe add some rice, a beaten egg put in slowly for threads, and lots of croutons.  I think this is great how this dish is turning out basically three different things.

The ""Oh My"" in your D-LUX Chocolate Chip Cookies most definitely belongs here.  WOWEEEE!  So good...definitely dangerous!!!  I made them with 2 eggs and they came out nice and fudgy  surrounded by the lightly crunchy, very colorful base/topping.  A BIG, BIG hit.

Add or subtract ingredients as to your liking and to add some desperately needed color to this dish. I added a bay leaf and a little sage, frozen peas, frozen pearl onions, chopped celery, more carrots, and a can of button mushrooms. 
Since the cream of chicken soup is loaded with flavor, don't sweat-it if you don't have any or enough chicken broth.
Adjust liquid as needed for desired thickness.
Great with biscuts!",2007-01-13

I boiled my chicken and left out the carrots and I totally screwed up on the amount of broth needed. I read it as 4 cups not 4 cans and needed to add a lot more liquid...so I added about 2 cups of milk which helped to make this really creamy and so darn good.

I only had about 1/2 of a large pkg of dry egg noodles so I basically halved the recipe, except I did use a whole can of lower sodium, low fat store brand of cream soup.  I also added a cup of diced celery and 3 cloves of minced garlic to the carrots and sauteed with the chicken.  This was a very quick and tasty meal when I really did not have the time to stand around and ""watch"" a meal on the stove.  I am glad I went with just the 1/2 pkg of noodles as that was PLENTY for the two of us.  The extra added veggies really made it colorful and added an extra depth of flavor.  Truly a comfort food... It tasted like a mix of chicken and dumplings and chicken pot pie... really delicious.  I served it with some soft dinner rolls and green beans.  Thanks for sharing!!!",2007-09-16

The first time I made this I did not use the frozen noodles, but I did use 3/4 of a 1 lb. box of shell noodles and cooked until al dente, which was only about 15 minutes. I also used one and a half of the 32 oz boxes of chicken broth since I buy those instead of cans. I will put in a bay leaf next time when I add the broth and carrots. Awesome meal and very easy! It did not taste like the traditional ""canned soup"" entree, which I hate. The poultry seasoning made it taste homemade. Update: I just made this with the frozen noodles, and its super good too. Either way, this comes out great. If your can't find the egg noodles, they are usually in the freezer section by the frozen raviolis. The brand I bought was Rheames. I also put in chopped celery and onion in with the carrots for more flavor and to get the kiddies to eat more veggies! Thanks for the recipe!",2008-09-22

I made as posted (well, perhaps added a bit more Kahlua - about a quarter cup more!!).  Only slight issue was that cake was really, really thick and it did not cook in 45 minutes, it took much longer, about 60 mins or so, but needed it - it was not burnt or anything.

Its a subtle curry with beautiful flavors. i did cut the heat in half bc i only had thai birds eye and they are very hot.

Made for Asia forum tag game",2008-01-14

We went on a holiday for a week and I brought back 40 plus new spices as my gift to myself... to be honest I don't know what half of them are, I like a challenge, so looked up kaffir leaves on my beloved Recipezaar and voila! a new recipe to try out!  
This was so tasty, I had to use chicken breast as that is what I had defrosted and it was so succulent, it did cook a bit quicker than thighs would have so next time I will thicken the sauce a bit with corn starch.  
I served it with a Moroccan  bean dish I made and it's mildness paired well with the curry.  I love Gordon Ramsay's recipes and will use this again.  Thank you for posting it.",2009-04-25

254495,2742289,4,1,This is not a quick meal but is worth the effort.  I felt it tasted more like a Thai dish than a Malaysian but I am not expert.  That is just the impression I got. I loved this dish and it had the complex flavours that I previously only experienced when eating in fine restaurants.  I will be making this one again for sure.  I also used chicken breast like another person mentioned and I skipped the Coriander altogether - I hate that stuff.,2013-03-24
254495,2829744,2,0,"I&#039;m sorry but I find Gordon&#039;s Malaysian chicken curry is not very Malaysian at all. I&#039;m Malaysian and I&#039;ve tried various styles of chicken curries in Malaysia. Please take note that we never ever use soy sauce, fish sauce and pepper in our curries! We also don&#039;t normally use fresh chillies to spice the curry. Instead, we use either dried chillies or chilli powder. We use fresh chillies mainly for garnishing. The Malays usually use curry powder in their curries even though some, esp the Indians prefer to make their own masala. And where are the curry leaves, the essential ingredients in Malaysian chicken curries? We don&#039;t usually use kaffir lime leaves in curries too, unless we make Malaysian nyonya chicken curry, rendang and asam pedas.",2013-05-17
254495,1800120210,5,1,I have been tempted to make a Thai Green curry for years and never had the courage - so glad I tried it though!  First attempt was gorgeous even though I had to buy a green curry paste as I had no mortar &amp; pestle to ground spices fresh. Second was even more incredible with really vibrant flavours - huge difference in using fresh ingredients as opposed to a ready made paste for curry sauce. I would highly recommend the dish to anyone. I added a few petite pois peas as they always seem to come in dishes I order in Thai restaurants and they looked cute &amp; tasted lovely.  Definitely a recipe I am going to stick to and cook weekly.,2013-10-12
254495,1802598204,2,0,Tried this recipe and it definitely was not Malaysian. It was alright but I will probably just stick to curry pastes when I make my curries in the future. I&#039;ve been using the Dollee curry pastes and it hasn&#039;t disappointed me. It is a lot quicker to prepare as well! Cooked it once for my flatmates and received compliments all round the table. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be making my curries from scratch anymore.,2014-03-26
254495,2000465741,5,1,Thank you Gordan Ramsay so much for this recipe. I no some are saying its deffenetly not Malaysian and taste more like thai but I don&#039;t really care my husband and three children could not get enough of it. They want me to make it once  week. I added broccoli &amp; carrot to the recipe and put fresh chilli &amp; coriander on the side yummy??,2015-09-10
254495,2000799941,5,1,I found this in his F-Word cookbook and decided to try it for a dinner party. I am aware that soy sauce isn&#039;t typically used in Mekong Delta cuisine in general (this seems to be a something that Western cooks like to do to up the saltiness - I&#039;ve seen Bobby Flay do the same thing) and the other critics are right - he should probably label this dish Thai instead of Malaysian because it definitely tasted like the curries at my favorite Thai restaurants. That being said I found it delicious as did my guests and I never thought I could make such a tasty curry dish on my own.,2016-01-04
254495,2001466369,5,1,"Despite the assertions in these reviews this is definitely not Thai and most certainly Malaysian. There are numerous Thai and Malaysian restaurants and street food markets in Perth where I live and this recipe is even better than some of my favourites. The curry I made from this recipe was absolutely top drawer. It is always worth making a paste from fresh ingredients rather than opening a jar. Sure, sometimes a jar is convenient but there is no comparison in flavour. This is spot-on as a Malaysian chicken curry. Add some potato when cooking and garnish with fresh chilli when serving.",2017-04-01

The only thing unusual about it is that it has lime leaves and fish sauce: both of which are not ingredients commonly used in Malaysian or Indonesian cooking. Just substitute the fish sauce with equal parts of soy sauce and omit the lime leaves altogether.

442657,1344711,5,1,"I also saw this recipe in NY Times, and I made it for Thanksgiving this year. Fabulous! I substituted chanterelles for crimini mushrooms, garlic paste for the chopped garlic, and added a cipollini onion to the shallot but otherwise used the stated ingredients. I baked my squash at 400 for about 50 minutes. I laid out my rolls directly on the parchment sheet so I wouldn't break them transferring them from the counter to the sheet, and I was glad I did. I baked my rolls at 375 instead of 400 because that's what the pastry dough package said -- probably a mistake, try it at 400 so the pastry dough doesn't underbake. (Even at 375 it was still pretty good, though.)<br/><br/>This recipe would probably be terrific made with other cheese and vegetable fillings, and DH wants me to try it with beef one of these days.

430866,705251,5,1,Sharon these are fantastic cookies!  We loved the texture of these cookies and it is hard to describe but they have a flaky/crispy outside and an extra soft inside.  We LOVED these cookies!  What a difference in making a cookie without shortening and white sugar - these have a much better flavor.  Have I said how much we love them?  Great with a cold glass of milk for dipping too.  Found and made in PRMR tag game.,2012-06-24

42360,167225,5,1,"The flavor is more like a gelatin dessert than tapioca pudding with milk and egg. The cereal topping is a great idea -- the mellow sweetness of the corn cereal was a lovely compliment to the tangy pudding. I didn't have cornflakes, so I crumbled some Crispix cereal on instead. I used an orange-pineapple-strawberry 100% juice blend. It was already a bit tart, but when cooked down, it was more intense, so I can see that with some juices added sugar might be good. The contrast of the corn topping evened it out well, too, though. ",2006-07-16

 Although we like meatloafs that have a sweet taste to them usually, that 'sweetness' did not go well with the spinach and cheese that was inside. Nobody in my family liked the sweetness of the topping, so next time I would omit that and maybe use a more tomato and garlicky tasting sauce on top, to keep it more on the 'Italian side' of the street.

79703,227586,5,1,"Very easy and delicious indeed!  DH really liked it!  I forgot to add the bacon in the end, so I just cooked the bacon while the casserole was baking and cut it up in tiny pieces.  When it was time to add the cheese I layered the bacon and then the cheese (that way I didn't get all the bacon fat in the dish).  Next time I might add chopped olives.  I also used brown rice.  Yummy, yummy, yummy.  If you are looking for a fast meal this is it!  The oven does all the work.  Thanks for a great recipe again!!",2005-10-30

Watch the baking time, mine was done about 10 minutes early. Used a 2.5 liter Corning Ware casserole which was the perfect size. Took Kittencal's advice and added some salt and a little garlic. Even the kids ate and enjoyed this which is very unusual, though they did pick out the green peppers. Leftovers were yummy for lunch the next day. Wonderful!

79703,146486,5,1,We LOVED this!  Very simple recipe with great flavor.  I used a 15oz can of corn so it was a bit more than called for and I omitted the peppers since I didn't have any.  I baked it in a 2.5 qt corningware dish and it fit perfectly. Mine was very done after an hour of covered baking though.  Thanks Kittencal!,2007-07-16

I love how easy this comes together, no cooking the the hamburger or anything prior to assembling. I may add another can of tomatoes next time, but this really needs no tweeking.

You know how some of the ground beef and rice recipes can be a bit lacking in flavor but you justy can't put your finger on what it needs? Well if you follow this recipe, plus add the garlic, seasoning salt, and parmesan you will not be lacking flavor of any sort! 
The only thing I did differently was I microwaved the bacon before adding it to the casserole.  Also, I only had 93% lean gr beaf, so i did have to use paper towels to absorb just a bit of grease, so next time I will be sure to use at least a 98% lean beef.

I made a mexican casserole out of it, next time I'll try the regular recipe.  I stirred about 1-2 T of my homemade cilantro pesto into the rice (it was a nice addition) and would put basil pesto for the regular recipe as well as some mushrooms over the meat layer.  The timing was right, but a 450 degree temperature is too hot for my oven, it burnt and stuck a little in the corners, so I think 425 would work better for me, perhaps increasing the cooking time a bit.

Next time I make this I'll either make my own white sauce or use cream of broccoli soup with milk. Thanx for posting!,2008-03-24

I made a half recipe using 75mL juice from organic lemons and the zest of 2 lemons (I dropped a bit, so we added a tiny bit of organic valencia orange zest as well).  Sweet-tart and a glistening rich gold color.  Very good balance of the flavors.  This is rich and intensely flavored- you don't need much, but you will want to eat it on everything.  I, like Heather, had no problem with this setting up- you do have to cook for the full amount of time, though.

My husbands family is from the south and I have made their from scratch recipe and it takes so long, so I was hoping for a great short-cut in this and I think I've still found it in the broth and with a rotisserie chicken, but I'll have to make the dumplings from scratch. We're used to super thin dumplings and though these were good, the texture is so different. My husband hasn't come home yet, but I know he'll say they're too thick.

I've read all the reviews on this one and decided to send her this recipe and she said it tasted so good.  Because of that, I wanted to try it for myself; I made this tonight and I have to say, it was definitely EASY and DEEELISH!

I've found that pulling the biscuits into tiny pieces tends to make them cook faster, and doesn't effect the taste or texture, unless you want them to be underdone. Otherwise 30 minutes isn't going to do it. And make sure that you stir them regularly. They will stick to the bottom and burn.",2013-03-11

The boyfriend loved them!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I uploaded a picture, if the coloring looks a little different than the others, it&#039;s because I chose to substitute beef stock instead of water, just as personal preference.  It blended great, and made the broth super rich (maybe a con to some, but we love rich broth). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I also added a little flour to thicken it up.  When I make dumplings from scratch, I always end up with thick broth, as loose flour tends to fall off the dumplings and thicken the surrounding broth.  The added flour mimicked this &quot;from scratch&quot; effect, and the boyfriend was none the wiser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;m still loyal to my grandma&#039;s backwoods Kentucky dumplings, but they&#039;re so time consuming.  Honestly, who can afford to spend an entire day cooking dinner?  Because of this, I&#039;ve pretty much eliminated dumplings from my day to day menu, but this recipe provided the perfect solution.  The shortcut was delicious, and far more practical than conventional dumplings.  I&#039;ll definitely be making them again.",2013-03-20

I used a 19.8 oz. dark chocolate brownie mix to balance the sweetness of the candy.  There did seem to be an awful lot of toppings so I think next time I will use a 9 x 13 inch pan so the topping is not so thick.  I cut these into smaller pieces since they are so rich.  FYI, I needed 6 fun-size snickers to get 3/4 of a cup and about a half a 14 oz. bag of M & M's.

I might try some things differently if I made it again, however.  We didn't like some of the textures. The strawberries were mushy, and the bread on top was too hard and crunchy.  I might leave the top layer of bread off if I made this again since there's no way for it to stay moist during baking.

This was terrific with Parmesan Crusted Broiled Scallops #16855 and some sauteed spinach.  I did bake in a Pyrex pie plate and only cooked for 45 mins.

The cheese was a low-fat Mexican mix (was what I had in fridge).  I also cooked my brown rice in vegetable broth.  As a result it was less souffle/quiche, more just rice/veggie/cheese casserole that held together well.  Either way, it turned out just great; my boyfriend really enjoyed it a lot too.

70860,183872,5,1,"Oh me, oh my! I made this frosting using Tofutti vegan cream cheese to frost vegan carrot-cake cupcakes with, and both were a hit with vegans and non-vegans alike. The balance of sweet, tangy, and creamy is just right, and the frosting is neither too thick nor too loose. In fact, this frosting is so good that I made more cupcakes just to use up the extra!  Thanks JamesDean'sGirl, for providing me with my new default cream-cheese frosting! ",2006-07-18

70860,522275,5,1,"I had absolutely no problems with the consistency of this recipe and made it as written. I pulled the cream cheese straight from the refrigerator, so maybe that helped?

NO LEFTOVERS and rave reviews all around! :)  Thanks, JD'sGirl!",2009-03-27

I don't like it at all. Everyone knows so they all crowd around me just waiting for my piece to be scraped of frosting and added to theirs. So after mixing the ingredients, I tested it in curiosity. OMG it was AMAZING! I actually ENJOYED IT so much that I couldn't stop liking my fingers while toping it on Extreme Lemon Bundt Cake! Thank goodness nobody was around because I must have looked silly licking that bowl. I knew I wasn't going to scrape my piece this time so I ended up making another quick batch and doubled the frosting for everyone. Including ME!! Since then I made it on 3 different cakes recipes.

70860,125388,5,1,"Wonderful lemon frosting, with just the right tang from the cream cheese.  I used this as a topping on a bundt cake, so I thinned it out a little with additional lemon juice.

70860,1829291,5,1,So good! I was making my dad a citrus cake for Father's Day. I used this for the frosting but added some orange zest and orange juice. It was super tasty and just the right combo of cream cheese and citrus tanginess!,2011-06-19
70860,469903,5,1,Wow - this was really yummy and a cinch to make!  Made the recipe for 3 cups to frost a 9x13 inch pan of lemon brownies. I'd probably add more lemon zest next time around and double the recipe to 4 cups if I were to do another 9x13.,2012-09-02

70860,1580637,5,1,Yum! Double it for sure as only one batch is only enough for a small one layer cake. I also think if you can zest/shave your lemon peel more finely it will look better. I used a chunky grater and you could see the lemon peel in the frosting. It wasn&#039;t ugly but might be prettier if the peel was more fine.,2014-10-12

I baked it in a 8x8 dish and used about 1/3 bag of mini tater tots.  My toddler thought she was starving so I had to speed up the cooking a bit by baking at 450 for only 30 minutes.  15 minutes into baking I put a couple handfuls of mexican blend shredded cheese on top.

105122,470351,4,1,"This was a very tasty and different tasting salad.  I really liked the dressing on this and I followed it exactly as stated.  I couldn't taste the italian breadcrumbs in this at all so for those of you who are worried about the addition of it, don't.  It just adds nicely to the texture.  Also, my husband could not believe there was Dijon in the dressing.  He couldn't pinpoint what the dressing's main flavor was but would never have guessed Dijon.  He enjoyed it as well!  Will make this one again.  May add in pepperoncini's in the future as I think it would be great in here as well.  Thanks for posting!",2008-10-17

I left out the pimento and put in diced marinated red pepper, a handful of sliced mushrooms and two Roma tomatoes cut into eighths. I also added a squeeze of anchovy paste to the dressing. I was a bit confused by the directions as it sounded as though I should add the dressing and then refrigerate for two hours. That's what I did and it was delicious. Loved the bread crumbs, which I had never done before. We had neighbors over for lasagna and both husbands had seconds of salad. I was about to toss out the leftover salad but my husband stopped me and asked to keep it for the next day. That was a first too! I will definitely make this again.",2017-03-14

He said he wanted a ""nut and chocolate chip"" muffin so we started in the muffins that contain pecans.  As soon as he saw this title he said ""How about those instead, mom?""  These were easy to put together and really tasty.  I used white wheat flour and skim milk to try to up the healthiness a tad.  The batter is sweet (though I'd up the cinnamon a bit) and the sticky muffin top is fabulous.  Really hit the spot when you're looking for something ooey-gooey but not horrible for you.

We don't have a lot of firefighters around to feed, although it could be argued that DangerBoy does eat like one. Anyway, we didn't need to feed a large crew, so we made 1/3 of the recipe. Instead of 28 ounces of crushed tomatoes, I used two pints of home canned diced tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. We also used only 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, as I have EXTREMELY hot cayenne, which I learned after preparing an old standby with the new stuff. But then, who knows, maybe my previous cayenne was shirking its incendiary duties. Oh, we also left out the hot pepper sauce because on top of the cayenne we knew we couldn't take it. Go ahead, call us cowardly. We can take it. We did like the soup a lot, except for it being way too hot for our wimpy palates. Next time, we have all agreed, we will prepare it as written but we'll just wave the cayenne over the soup pot instead of actually adding it in. ;-)",2004-10-11

What a difference that made. The salad was a lot more creamy, and stayed creamier for several days in the fridge. When making the salad, I cooked the macaroni seperately, plus I boiled the eggs seperately. I only added 1/2 cup of thinly sliced celery, 1 small green onion, plus a 2-ounce jar of diced pimientos, which I drained on paper toweling. When adding a bit more of the sauce, I halved the dressing, but only added 1/4 teaspoon of the Season-All Salt.

54034,607692,4,1,"Very easy and yummy!  I was pleasantly surprised by the flavors and lightness of the recipe.  I agree with another reviewer in that this is not a pound cake, but more like a banana spice cake.",2011-09-26

This would be great to bring on a camping trip, or to store in your desk at work for a quick meal.  
I canned these and gave them in Christmas baskets.",2005-01-03

I am definetly going to give this to her as part of a Christmas basket. Thank you so much. Also, ideal for quick lunches, or for camping. I think it would be great for the elderly also, as most older people seem to love potato soup! It goes down easy and is quick and tasty.
A definite keeper!!

I used all chicken stock (soup base actually) as I had no wine. For the fruit I used dried mixed fruit that contained apple, peach and prune as well as the apricot. I didn't weigh it out but I'm sure I used more than 3 oz's.

It was still wonderful! nicely sweet with only the fruit and yet savory with the chicken stock and onion. This will be on our table again through out fall and winter. 

What a lovely change from the same old pork chops!",2005-10-01

I could also taste olive oil quite a bit.  Other than that, none of the other flavors really shined.  We got a hint of this and a hint of that, but it was more neutral than anything.  I may or may not make this again, but if I do, I think I would definitely increase the mustard and honey, and I would probably skip the olive oil.

Where is says ""beat the wet ingredients,"" I think it means to beat just the egg and the sour cream, because then it says to add the milk and the butter. You should probably say to use a whisk, because I assumed it said to use a mixer and that wasn't necessary. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe and a teaspoon of lemon zest. I used soymilk instead of milk and Earth Balance Coconut spread instead of butter. The flavor was ok.

Even unchilled without letting the flavors meld together, it was fabulous! Unfortunately, I had a few problems. The first was that the mango I bought for it was icky. I ended up using a can of drained tropical fruit salad and chopping it up a bit more. It also turned out that my powdered onion was actually onion salt, so I sort of used minced, dried onion and the onion salt. If it tastes better with the proper ingredient, I don't think I'll ever get it chilled. I left off the jalapenos because we're either wimpy or we have stomach problems.

Maybe it was the green pepper, maybe some condiment was missing. If this wasn't a contest recipe, I'd have tweaked it. The tiny bit of cinnamon was lost, and anyway, cinnamon would not complement green pepper in any way.

I exchanged the canned whole tomatoes for 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes - one diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro and one with chilies and diced tomatoes.  I also left out the cinnamon as I just couldn't visualize that in this soup.  I did add 1 extra diced potato.  I also used beef broth rather than vegetable broth as that was what I had on hand.  Very, very good.  Thanks for posting.",2009-12-31

To lighten this a bit I used turkey sausage instead of ground beef and only half the amount; I made up the difference with quartered fresh mushrooms which I sauteed with the other veggies.

Greasy but I drained all of that off in the grill.  I had to use beef broth and only used 1 tsp of dried thyme.  But they still had a great flavor.

I just think it was a lot of work and time for what we got.

I used Recipe #224053 for the sweet & sour sauce.  The only thing I might do differently next time is half the amount of rice vinegar because combined with the S&S sauce it was a bit heavy on the vinegar side for me, but still good.

They do come out extra squishy, as noted on the recipe, but they stay that way even after cooling.  The second time I made them I baked them a few minutes longer (10-12) and they were better.  Next time I may add a touch of gluten-free flour to thicken them up a tad more, or cut back the butter slightly.  <br/><br/>Also note, not all oatmeal is gluten free.  Some companies dust the oats in flour to help thicken the oatmeal.  If you really need gluten free food, get gluten free oatmeal.  I used Bob's Red Mill gluten free oatmeal in these cookies and it worked great.",2012-08-18

I&#039;ve used a pretzel M&amp;M and holiday dark chocolate M&amp;M mix here and splashed a bit of Saigon cinnamon in the batter. I also love Heath pieces, and I always add 1 full cup of raisins. Chilling the dough very well and keeping it cold in between batches is key. Eleven minutes is the perfect time for me. Cooling for ten minutes on the cookie sheet and sliding them onto wax paper keeps them chewy. Thanks for the great post!",2014-12-05

My sons are very picky and never finish their dinner and it was GONE!  The only things I changed were:  I added more chicken broth (I like it to have more of a sauce) I used a whole can...and used two fresh lemons ( it was nice and tart)  and added mushrooms.

I used much less than 1/4 cup of olive oil since I was only browning 1/2 a breast. I made the full amount of sauce as I was serving it over spaghetti. One cup of olives seemed excessive, I used 1/2 C and it was just fine. Next time, I'll cut the lemon juice by 1 or 2 Tbs. and I think it'll be just perfect for my taste.

I also left out the cream.  It came out quite good!  Although I haven&#039;t tried it in my pressure cooker, thinly sliced pork loin can be used instead of chicken.

I have to remember that next time. Also i used my George Foreman grill and it worked great! the mayo formed a very crispy crust and the George Foreman squashed it down a little bit.

Dissolved the yeast and sugar (splenda) in the warm water.  Added the milk salt and melted butter and mixed that well with the blade.  Switched to the dough hook and added 4 cups of all purpose flour and it turned out wonderful.  I gave it a little extra time to rise the second time, maybe 30 minutes.  Light, airy, flavorful dinner rolls that I'll make again.  Thanks Bayhill.  Made for SSC Pet Parade.",2008-07-26

Taking this soup to work will help me beat these munchie moments in a far healthier way without guilt. I've done a taste test and I already know I will be making this again often.

I did find that the cheaper store breand ""oreo's"" worked better then the Oreo brand.  The cream center was softer on the store brand and the stick went in better.

I would definitely recommend freezing the cookies to keep the sticks in.By the way, I couldn't get Popsicle sticks here so I begged the Starbucks girls to give me some wooden coffee stick stirrers and they were fine if a little tall.

After a little research and then obtaining all the supplies, I did 3 batches over 6 hours and was pretty happy with the results! I used vanilla 'candy melts' (1 pound), rather than white chocolate chips, which I melted in a Chocolatiere electric melting pot (well worth the $25 investment!) I used 'double stuff' oreos (10 per batch) and carefully inserted a lollipop stick (from the craft store) through the center of the white filling almost until it met the opposite side, for each cookie...I dipped one half/side in the white chocolate candy melts, then chilled to set in the fridge for 20 min...After the first half/side set, I dipped the other half/side of the cookie in the chocolate, sprinkled immediately with all different kinds of sprinkles and returned again to the fridge to chill to set...I also bought clear little baggies and silver colored twist ties to cover the 'oreo lollipop'... I repeated this process with 2 more batches (10 pops each)...For the 2nd batch, instead of sprinkles, I placed red and green M&Ms similar to how Goochie137 shows in her photo for this recipe (like a 'flower')...For the 3rd batch I used pink M&Ms (again like a 'flower') for breast cancer awareness...Needless to say, when I arrived at the bake sale they descended upon me like crazy people and barely let me 'display' them before buying them all at $1 PER lollipop (30 total)!

I inserted hollow lollipop sticks into each oreo, then froze them for about 10 minutes.  While they were freezing, I melted my chocolate (half white, half milk Wilton brand melts), then took out half the cookies at a time to dunk.  I will say that the milk chocolate was much better for dunking and it was easy to get a really nice, smooth professional look than the white chocolate.  Sprinkled both with valentine garnishments and can't wait to wrap up and gift to DH tomorrow.  I think next time I'll just do the milk chocolate- and this will become my staple gift for many!

However, I just gently pressed them back together.  Then, I put them in the freezer for 15 minutes.  I coated them in almond bark.  We decorated them with M&Ms to look like spring flowers.

268614,220195,4,1,"This is really good, especially using beets freshly pulled from the garden, as their earthy sweetness adds an essential layer of flavor. Simple, healthy, and delicious, which are all the criteria I usually have! I don&#039;t agree that all three elements can be cooked in the same water in the same pot, as the greens do stick to the sides and need to be drained and rinsed out, plus the beets and the potatoes need to be started in cold water, not hot water. Be sure you use waxy potatoes for this, not russets.  I cooked and drained and shocked the greens, started a fresh pot of cold water with both the beets and the potatoes in it, checked doneness every 10 minutes with a metal skewer, and removed each root/tuber as it was cooked. The beets finished cooking before the potatoes. Also, be sure to season the water liberally with salt, especially for the greens. The beets and potatoes can be cooked ahead and marinated in the dressing, and the cooked greens added later so the lemon doesn&#039;t brown them. We had this because I was looking for a potato side to go with grilled flank steak and grilled asparagus, plus I had a few smallish beets with tops from the garden.

323235,2001472396,5,1,"My wife likes it, so it gets a 5-star rating. :) I'm glad I read through the comments and cut the sugar back to only a 1/2 cup instead of 2/3. And I might add a bit more vinegar. But overall it came out surprisingly well considering I BBQ a heck of lot more than actually cook, and never deep fried anything before. I used some leftover smoked pork loin from the night before so it picked up a bit of the rub and smoke from that, too. (Any leftover BBQ usually finds its way into chili, stew, enchiladas, tacos, sammies, etc. so now I have one more use for it.) If anything was not as I expected it was the &quot;batter&quot; on the pork, but that is probably more my fault and possibly too much pork.",2017-04-05

36036,187373,4,1,Very tasty quick bread.  I did sub fresh cooked sweet potato in place of the pumpkin as I think they are really similar in taste and one potato made the right amount of puree.  I did add a little less than 1 Tbsp zest--nectarine since that's what I had.  I also subbed pecans and put in more than called for since we really like a lot of nuts in the bread.

I made small pockets on top of the roast and placed a little minced garlic and a dash of teriyaki sauce just to fill the hole.

I halved this recipe because I was making it for a two person lunch/snack.  I couldn't find refried black beans, even in Arizona, go figure!!!  So I used regular refried pinto beans and just added black beans to it for texture.  I drained the rotel before adding it and I pretty much added the whole can of that.  I like spicy so I added an extra 1/2 tsp of adobo sauce too.

A few were so thin that they just put the butter on top of the cinnamon sugar topping. I also added 1 tbsp of sugar to the dough. The 2 of them ate the whole batch warm from the oven with their ham and eggs so they couldn't have been too bad! lol. I like the choice given in the recipe for savory or sweeter scones.",2006-12-28
112640,498451,5,1,"We all agreed these are AWESOME!! I made them with Parmesan/Romano cheese and dried basil (2 tsp. instead of 2 tbsp.) I didn't have any dry mustard, so I put a couple of dashes of garlic powder in instead.

These were easy, however, I want to mention that mine after adding nearly all of the buttermilk were very sticky, so I rolled them out on a well floured surface to keep them from sticking to it. They came out with a more cakelike texture than biscuits, and I'm hoping that is the way they are supposed to be.

42170,209255,4,1,This was quite good.  I enjoy the taste but the texture is not really for me.  I find it a little too chewy.  That may have been because the baking time should have been about 5-10 minutes less.  I was busy and forgot to check on it.

I did not like the dill in this recipe.  It over pwered other flavors.  Also, this recipe had soooo many spices, and ketchup, etc., that you really lost the naturally spicy flavor of the lamb.

I am an amateur when it comes to deep frying foods, so take my opinion for what it's worth (virtually nothing). lol.

The batter is absolutely fantastic and I will be trying it with other foods (chicken, etc.) I tried cooking them one at a time on the first few, just to get the hang of cooking them, and I highly suggest butterflying the shrimp if possible.  That way you get more surface area covered with the yummy batter!

I used this recipe after reading about 10 -  as it seemed just perfect for my needs.  I admit to ""doctoring"" the recipe a little...  I added more vanilla extract, another 1/4 tablespoon or so; added 1/4 teaspoon almond extract and  the grated peel of a quite small lemon - could have used orange peel also, but I had the small lemon right at hand.  All I can say is these were killer!!!  I don't actually adore dessert, not a big sweets eater but had 12 women for dinner at home and needed to provide dessert.  So, I made these cupcakes; let them cool, sliced off the top - 1/4"" or 1/2""....  I put a big tablespoon of cooked vanilla pudding on the bottom half, put the top back on and squished them down a little so both sides stick together.  Then I put the cupcakes on  pan with a rack insert, poured Bakers Semi-Sweet chocolate I had melted into a thick pourable consistency to use as a topping"".  The result?  One delicious cupcake with pudding in every bite and a little chocolate topping - YUM, YUM, YUM!  <br/><br/>Even though I'm not a real dessert person, I thought these were just delicious.

12966,13029,4,1,"Really liked this. Very creamy and rich, though; wish I'd made a salad to go along with it! I think I'll cut back on the mayo next time. I didn't have any corn chips or corn flakes, so I used bread crumbs instead. I'm sure corn flakes would be yummier!",2002-02-16
12966,25455,3,0,Very bland.  Didn't care for the combination of chicken with boiled egg.  The egg taste was too overpowering--made the whole dish taste more like egg salad than chicken anything.,2002-02-19
12966,31841,5,1,"This dish was a big hit with my family.  I added a small bottle of sliced mushrooms and topped it with crushed Ritz crackers (no butter) and served it with rice and a tossed salad.  It was quick and easy to prepare, and I will definitely serve this again!",2002-02-22
12966,111520,3,0,"This was good, but revised it by adding: a can of drained water chestnuts, 1/2 cup sour cream & sprinkled cheese on the top -- when baked, sprinkled paprika on top.",2007-03-03
239512,335737,4,1,"I gave it a 4 star because it didn't raise any at all. It ended up sorta gummy but I am sure that was my fault. I'm going to try it again soon. But taste wise, it deserved a 5 star rating. I used splenda instead of sugar, so maybe that was my mistake. Hope someone can tell me. I recomend it to anyone at all far as taste goes. Its delicious!",2007-09-22
239512,1216753,5,1,Positively delicious Key Lime flavor. USE the sugar! Splenda is almost worthless for baking IMO... even the baking blend with sugar can give IFFY results... and I am a diabetic! Just use a little restraint and DO NOT eat the whole cake at one sitting. An alternative lifestyle for diabetics that I've adopted... savor such delicious indulgences in small servings and GIVE AWAY half (or more) to friends! They will love you all the more... and maybe invite you over for dinner!,2010-05-24
239512,1635710,4,1,"This cake has a great flavor, was more dense than I thought it would be.  I did substitute butter for the 1/2 cup shortening because I use butter in all my other pound cakes.  I also used cake flour to give it a lighter texture.  My glaze was wonderful, I added 4 oz. cream cheese and substituted powdered sugar for the white sugar and also added a little key lime zest along with the juice and a 1-2 tablespoons of milk.  Everyone found it to be delicious.",2010-06-21
239512,218535,1,0,Really don&#039;t know how to say this but this is not good - bland and blah.,2014-12-29
306190,60231,5,1,"Really great! I made a couple small changes though. Used green pepper instead of red, chicken broth instead of wine, add a can od fire-rosted diced tomatoes, a little tomato paste, and tomato puree, and simmered it till everything was just tender. We had it over linquine, with Parmesan and a mozzarella/provolone blend.
Thanks!",2008-06-19
306190,2747074,4,1,This is easy and healthy. I rated it 4 stars as I felt it was a little acidic. I&acute;m not sure what to add to counter the acidity. But all the same I liked it and would make again.,2013-03-21
345195,571112,5,1,"My husband and I just discussed making these for New Year's Eve and I thought I'd check to see if the recipe was posted.  As indicated, these definitely are delicious and addictive!  I always use a foil-lined jelly roll pan for easier clean up.  I never measured the brown sugar because I didn't have an actual recipe, but I know I don't use that much.  DO try these - you won't be disappointed!  Thanks for posting the recipe :)",2008-12-26
345195,382203,5,1,"These are just wonderful little treats, I have been making them for a couple of years and people just love them.  You can make them ahead by wrapping the smokies in the bacon and freezing at this stag.  Thaw and bake as recipe indicates",2008-12-27
345195,594229,5,1,I made these for a New Year's Eve party.  I used 2 pounds of bacon and almost 3 packages of cocktail weiners.  I came home with an empty crock pot!  I didn't use a full 2 cups of brown sugar.  I liberally sprinkled the two pans with brown sugar but I know it wasn't 2 cups. The one mistake I won't make again is to line the pans with foil.  They were a mess to clean up but so worth it!,2012-01-01
32518,87678,3,0,"Pork chops tasted pretty good, but It's not one recipe that I would make again.",2003-05-28
32518,1060364,5,1,very good,2009-01-12
204461,107583,5,1,"You've done it again, Susie!  Another winner.  Very moist and flavorful.  Thanks for posting this one!",2007-06-17
204461,293410,5,1,"Yep, excellent muffins! As you noted they don't rise too high, but taste lovely. My changes: all ww pastry flour; 1/4 cup sugar in place of splenda; vegan subs for buttermilk and egg; and I had to use pecans as I was out of walnuts. I forgot the topping but they're great anyway! Thanks!",2007-11-13
243445,199848,5,1,"This soup is wonderful!  The blue cheese flavor is very subtle, but still there.  I added a little onion, but made no other changes.  I really loved the ""bisque-like"" texture.  The swirled cream makes a pretty presentation.  Thanx!",2008-11-13
46183,78808,5,1,"Wow!!!  This was incredible garlic bread.  I went with the mozzarella and left off the parmesan cheese, and it came out just perfect.  My hubby and I both thought it was the best garlic bread we have had.  The roasted garlic added a wonderful dimension to it!  Served it with Jo Mama's World Famous Spaghetti #22782, and we couldn't have dreamed of a more wonderful dinner.  Thanks so much for this fantastic recipe!!",2003-08-21
46183,119070,4,1,"Very good and spicy I liked it a lot but I'm a spicy food type of guy. My wife though is kinda soft.  Anywhoo the bread was great! If you are sensitive to cayenne pepper go easy on that.

OVERALL THIS IS A GREAT RECEPIE.",2003-12-27
46183,65056,5,1,"This is good!  I made only about a half recipe, 8 slices.  The roasted garlic makes these special.  I omitted the parmesean and just used mozzarella, which was very nice.  I did bake open-faced on a cookie sheet and it turned out lovely, browned and crisp.  I like that this gives you lots of freedom to make it how you like it.  I've never had garlic bread with mayonnaise on it before, which makes it really lovely and moist.  It doesn't taste so mayonnaise-y after its been heated, just a lovely buttery  flavor.  I also like the herbs.  We usually just do garlic bread with olive oil, minced garlic and a sprinkle of salt, so this is a nice change- much richer, for sure!   I am sure this would be a hit with the whole family, especially since you can adjust it to your personal taste.  Served with White Bean Piccata  #89516 for a great dinner.  Thanks!  ",2004-09-24
46183,170628,5,1,"OUTSTANDING!  Crispy on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside.  A perfect garlic bread.  We used mozzarella this time, but it would be delicious without it, too.  I was worried the mayo would make it greasy....not at all.  PERFECT!",2005-01-07
46183,199708,5,1,"It's amazing!  I cheated - didn't have any real garlic, so I just added more minced.  I know, I know, it must be even better with the roasted.  I skipped the cheese, too.  It was soooo good.  DH and the kids loved it.  We had extra slices for dessert. ;)",2006-09-09
46183,839389,5,1,"In one word...YUM!  I love garlic bread and many of the store bought brands I've tried just aren't that good to me.  This recipe was awesome, with or without the cheese!  The garlic butter hardens up when you put it in the fridge - so I always make extra just to have on hand.  It is also great on baked potatoes!",2008-05-14
46183,27876,5,1,"OMG!  This garlic bread was out of this world!  I followed the directions, and added the melted mozzarella.  My family and company said it was the most delicious garlic bread ever (and we LOVE garlic bread!).  I roasted the garlic early in the day, and kept in saved at room temp.  It saved me some time that evening.  Super recipe!",2008-08-04
46183,984823,5,1,Absolutely the best Garlic Bread on Earth..! Follow the intructions to the letter...YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!,2008-10-21
46183,1629612,5,1,"Best Ever! Try it on the grill, try it with fresh herbs....WOW.  It gets devoured!",2012-06-29
81893,196322,5,1,"Excellent recipe, use fillet mignon when I have it, also like to fry up some onions and mix it with beef after finished cooking.",2012-11-30
11556,804550,4,1,"Very good spaghetti sauce! I used garlic sausage instead of the hot, plus I added mushrooms. In addition I used a yellow pepper and served it over top of Ramen Noodles minus the seasoning packet. I doubled the recipe so I could freeze the leftovers.",2008-11-25
320553,156034,5,1,"Made and reviewed for 2008 Football Tag Win Week 7---Absolutely awesome!!  I'm not a fan of cinnamon raisin bread and ALMOST substituted it, but knew that wouldn't be a fair review.  BOY, am I glad I didn't change a thing.  The combindation of flavors is awesome!!  Slightly salty from the ham but mainly sweet.
Waylon (the 14 month old) really enjoyed his too!",2008-10-29
320553,498271,5,1,"Delicious and tasty breakfast!  Loved the oj in the egg dip, gave the sandwich a nice sunny flavor.  I didn't have any marmalade so just topped with the powdered sugar and just a bit of syrup.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!",2011-09-07
320553,296809,5,1,"Made for the FYC Tag Game (made twice already). I used freshly-squeezed OJ &amp; liked that subtle flavor a lot. I used ham from a glazed ham instead of deli-sliced ham. Like another reviewer, I skipped the marmalade &amp; just used a slather of butter w/powd sugar added over it. The ingredients have a rich, fresh taste &amp; a perfect combo of sweetness w/the saltiness of the ham. We are breakfast food lovers for both morning &amp; evening dining. Your recipe was excellent for both. Thx for sharing it w/us.",2014-12-17
52138,39389,4,1,"Great tasting economical dish! The caraway flavoring is excellent. I used sui choy instead of green cabbage. Will defintely make again.
Thank you for posting
Catherine",2003-01-28
52138,79760,4,1,"Recipe doesn't say when to add the rice, I suggest putting the rice at the bottom. DH made this but put some of the rice at the top, under the soup but it didn't cook very well.

Really, really yummy though! DH LOVED this, and so did I. Thank you.",2003-07-03
52138,131915,4,1,My mother used to make this in an electric skillet. I haven't had it in years.  I left out the green pepper but it is wonderful. Thanks for reminding me! ,2004-03-18
333036,4470,4,1,The flavor was wonderful but the Kale was very very tough - Not the fault of the recipe.  I steamed it for 10 minutes where the usual time would be about 3 minutes and it was still very tough.  I will recook it and see what happens -I have never had tough Kale before. This is a very attractive recipe with the Leeks mixed in,2009-10-08
333036,615591,4,1,It made kale (not my favorite) pretty good.,2009-10-19
126532,182809,5,1,"I made these lovely potatoes for Jan's cook-a-thon. They were just a beautiful yellow-orange color, darker then the picture shown. That may have been because I started out with Yukon Gold potatoes which are a light lemon color. I did not find saffron powder and did not want to use turmeric in its place(taste, you know), I just ground some more threads to add. I used homemade stock also. I found that they needed something to perk up the flavor for my taste. So after they were done (and tasted), I carmelized half a Spanish onion,thinly sliced in 1 tbls. grapeseed oil and added. This along with some white pepper added just enough vavoom. Thanks for another ""turn"" of the potato!",2006-02-08
126532,47892,4,1,"I just had to add more saffron. It must be the Spanish in me. Good recipe!
Next time I would like to try fingerling potatoes for fun.",2006-03-15
157172,107135,5,1, i love these thanks for posting dee,2006-07-06
157172,129201,5,1,Very tasty indeed! We enjoyed these as part of an appetizer meal and they were a big hit. Loved the basil and garlic flavours. Thanks for a lovely recipe!,2006-07-13
157172,282842,4,1,"I made these as party canapes and they disappeared the fastest!  I added a slice of ham to half of them for those who preferred the traditional croque monsieur.  I also dipped the sandwiches in an egg white/skim milk wash (ala French toast) before frying and quartering, which made them nice and gooey, but still held up well as finger food.  Note, I would avoid if you only have bland, out-of-season tomatoes.",2006-11-26
157172,242729,5,1,"C'est formidable! I LOVED this my lovely catty's friend! I also added some thinly slcied tomatoes to the sandwich for another layer of texture.......and as my basil is not out yet, I added parsley instead of basil. Made for my lunch today and served with a small green salad and yet MORE fresh tomatoes, I LOVE them! A great veggie alternative to the ussual ham croque monsieur - merci! FT:-)",2009-05-26
263496,1142649,5,1,"I grew up on this recipe. My grandmother and mother both used this recipe. We of course double, tripled, or quadrupled to serve a crowd. I don't really measure anymore. Best if baked but if you're in a hurry you can microwave in a glass casserole dish.",2009-01-25
301488,704950,5,1,"These are great!  I haven't had grits since I left my home town in the South.  Had never had them with jalapeno before.  Just did a pinch of ground thyme because I didn't have fresh.  I will make these again with even more jalapeno because these were really mild.  Loved it, thanks!!!",2008-05-13
26604,836171,4,1,"A bit sweet for my taste, but my husband could not stop eating it.  He finished the entire thing... which was a disappointment to my teen boys who didn't get to taste what they helped cook!  I used fresh sweet potatoes and 1 lb of bulk breakfast sausage, crumbled.",2008-10-20
19937,227607,5,1,WOW!!!! I loved this.  This will be made a lot this summer.  When hubby is grilling I will have him throw the veggies on the grill for me then I will make it for me to have over the next few days. YUMMY!!,2007-05-25
28627,47230,5,1,Now this really did it for me. Chicken salad surrounded by beautiful summer fruits. Wonderful presentation. The chicken salad has a great flavor. I think it is the curry that makes it so good. Very classy and elegant. Thanks.,2002-07-10
28627,49360,5,1,"I had some girlfriends over and this is what I served. In my opinion, this is the perfect summer lunch. Delicious fresh fruit and creamy chicken salad. The girls and I gave this a resounding 5-stars. It went well with our Pina Coladas too :)",2002-07-28
88862,74736,5,1,"This banana cake was a terrific addition to our fourth of July party! The cake itself was very moist, but it's the filling that really makes this cake. I did add more powdered sugar to the buttercream filling, and make sure when making this recipe you use the butter that evelyn calls for. I tried to use margarine for the frosting and it contains too much water so it wouldn't set up. Terrific tasting banana cake for those who love banana and coffee, my family LOVED it! ",2004-07-05
88862,182010,5,1,"I can't give this all the stars it deserves--only five.  I made the cake into twenty four perfect cupcakes, and iced them with Ev's frosting--they were delicious, rich but light, delicate, elegant little desserts which everyone loved.  I followed the cake recipe exactly, using buttermilk.  For the frosting, I used 3/4 cup dark brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar.  I did not have instant coffee so ground french roast beans very fine and made some very strong, carefully filtered coffee.  Also, I mixed and mixed so that the frosting, before the addition of the butter was already very thick and fluffy.  I added the butter one tablespoon at a time and found that 10 tablespoons (about five ounces) of butter made for a fabulous frosting--so I stopped there.  And one more note:  we had a bit of frosting and a few cupcakes left; they froze beautifully and were still moist and tender and the icing still fluffy when defrosted.  One of these days I'll have to make the filling and come back and rave some more.  You've done it again, Evelyn!",2006-05-18
88862,315565,4,1,I made this today to take to a family afternoon tea. It is an easy cake to whip up. I only made one of the buttercream recipes to put in the middle and then added choc chips to the remainder to go on top so made it look really &#039;dirty&#039;. Great way to use up blackening bananas. Made for ZWT9.,2013-07-21
88862,480195,5,1,"This is a great recipe. The flavor is excellent. I didn&#039;t change a thing and everyone in the house loved it. It was mysteriously gone the next morning. Just a dirty cake plate left on the counter. I will be making this again, for sure. Thanks for sharing a really good recipe.",2013-07-27

247709,383346,4,1,"This is quite simple and special.  I cooked the salmon yesterday.  I used half a roma tomato, romaine lettuce.  I think it would be better to mix all the ingredients and then put in the martini glasses.  Or finish with the salmon on top.  Thanks Annacia.  Made for Holiday tag.",2008-11-16
305799,498271,4,1,"This is a nice, easy, family-friendly casserole!  I used fresh red peppers instead of bottled, otherwise made as specified.  The breadcrumb topping was a great touch.  We enjoyed this casserole very much - thanks for posting the recipe!",2008-11-08
305799,118840,4,1,"This was well-received at our table with a few adjustments - I was concerned about there being no salt or pepper, so I did add those, and also sprinkled with Parmesan before baking instead of using the breadcrumbs (just because it was easier!).  Also, I didn't bake it anywhere near as long as the recipe instructs ... I think I went about 30 minutes, just until it was bubbly and the cheese started to brown a little.  Thanks for sharing - this will be made again in our home!",2009-05-11
22329,9869,5,1,"Great flavours in this lamb roast.
Very different to how we normally have a leg of lamb, but we love mushrooms and the idea of having a sauce as well was very appealing.
The lamb was tender and it makes oodles of sauce, which was great because it was a perfect 'gravy' over the meat and mashed potatoes. Thanks for posting Jan.  =)",2002-05-19
22329,46172,4,1,"As usual for me I generally try the recipe exactly as directed.  Then the next time I modify according to taste.  This recipie was no different except I put slivers of garlic in the lamb before roasting.  The flavor overall was excellent.  If I was to change one thing next time it would be simply to cut down the chicken broth.  It called for 2 cups of chicken broth. That is about 1 1/3 10oz cans.  I opened a second can but found I could have just used one can and still have plenty of liquid for gravy.  I did have to reduce the gravy (as the recipe said might happen) after the lamb was done, as it was a bit thin.  Over all however a tasty recipie.  I served the gravy over a white rice with green beans (my favorite vegie!).",2003-11-09

132893,125388,5,1,Good flavor and easy to put together.  I tweaked the recipe somewhat - I only did two layers (total of 4 tortillas).  I used red salsa one one layer and green salsa on the other.  I also added some black beans with the chicken.  Great use for leftover chicken.,2006-11-25
132893,207478,5,1,"So easy to do - store bought ingredients that come together to make a really good meal!!  I even found low carb tortillas!!  Thanks littleturtle, this is definitely a keep and do often recipe!!!",2007-06-24

511988,1802587891,4,1,"I doubled the recipe &amp; added a tsp vanilla, I also used a little less than the 1/2 c honey. I used an unsweetened raw cacao powder. I mixed it all in the ninja blender. I was a thick fluffy batter. The first thing if noticed is how much they smell like regular cupcakes while baking. They did form to my silicone cupcake pan and rose just to the top of each muffin hole. At 20 mins, a toothpick came out clean &amp; they fell right out of the pan onto a cooling rack. The bottoms look a little dark so maybe less time on the next batch. I made 12 cupcakes and had a little batter left over. &lt;br/&gt;I cut one ope n, still steaming, and split it with my husband. We both agree that these are pretty darn good. They are less sweet than traditional cupcakes &amp; I have to iced them so maybe that will make a difference. But still quite yummy. They are a little grainy textured but fluffy and moist at the same time. I will definitely make these again. Happy birthday to my little guy!",2014-03-16
511988,1803418135,4,1,No direction onhow much honey to add to the cupcakes or how much coconut oil to add for the frosting. Paleo baking seems to be an exact science and im a bit worried about ruining these for my son&#039;s birthday. Hopefully google will have a suggestion.,2015-06-12

317912,28177,3,0,"We weren't crazy about this recipe.  There really wasn't much flavor to it.  The coffee & the spices were overpowered by the whipped cream & the mascarpone.  Even the cherry flavor was barely recognizeable.  As a whole I think that with some adjustments this would be a really great treat.  My biggest problem was that the ingredient list states both phyllo & puff pastry dough.  Since the contest ingredient was phyllo, and because DH always wants to get the right thing when he's shopping for me, I had both sheets & pre-made mini phyllo cups.  The instructions state that a mini muffin tin is needed so I used the pre-made mini cups.  While the instructions continue to say phyllo, they are clearly instructions for working with puff pastry dough.  Basically, the recipe does not work with phyllo dough. Placing one cherry in the phyllo cup left no room for filling.  I ended up chopping the cherries & stirring them into the filling.  I had an enormous amount of filling leftover but the box of phyllo cups only had 15 in it so I can't really complain about that.  The chef's photos are definitely puff pastry & if I try this again I will use just that.  Thanks for sharing your creation, Chef*Lee!  Made for Hidden Gems Event - Winter 2008.",2008-12-13
317912,1169989,5,1,These are so good!  Taste like French pastry.  The creme mixture is just right for a creme puff and the cherry surprise is lovely!  I took these to our church Valentine's party and we loved them!!,2009-02-14
377781,67656,4,1,"Quick easy and healthy.  I used frozen corn kernels for the green peppers and otherwise followed the recipe.  The flavor combination is very good and appealing for adults and kids alike. I julienned my zucchini and they were just done, any larger and it would not have been enough. I especially liked the crispy bottom of my burritos and would opt for broiling the tops before melting the cheese.  Thanks Dreamer.",2009-07-25

31220,12657,5,1,"Hearty and wonderful tasting! I used water instead of chicken stock to make this vegetarian, and used green bell peppers and dried rosemary and basil, since that's all I had on hand. I crushed the dried herbs before adding them to the chowder, which really causes the flavours to burst out beautifully! I will definitely make this again; thanks Braunda!",2002-06-20

Definitely will make this again.  ",2006-05-14

I used all tofu instead of pork/shrimp, since I don't eat pork, and they were just excellent. I did add just a bit of extra seasoning (more salt and sesame oil especially) since the tofu tastes a little bland on its own. Tasty litty balls of yumminess--LOL. Thanks for recommending this to me!",2006-03-11

A tablespoon of salt combined with the fish sauce definitely was waaaay too much, and I couldn't stand eating more than two before the salt took me out of the running.

419104,163112,4,1,Easy & delicious! The only trouble I had was the lemon curd would not spread OVER the cream cheese mixture - I ended up with kind of a marbled effect.  I would suggest either refrigerating for awhile before topping with lemon curd or just mixing it all together at the start.  An easy & delicious dessert that I will make for my guests in Maine!

It was also really, really easy to make.  I used a store bought nilla wafer crust and I also made my own lemon curd with my recipe recipe #429423.  I let my filling chill for 1 1/2 hours before topping it with the lemon curd layer.  I had no problem at all spreading it over top.  Thanks, GailAnn for another keeper.",2010-06-20

I had my fantasy birthday cake! It all happened so terrific! Before I could make it for me, a girlfriend of mine at work knew I wanted this cake. She called me at lunch time and invited me to the break-room. I arrived to find 24 donuts (mixed), 3 cans of whipped cream, a large red plate and a quart of strawberries. I died. I laughed so hard. We stood in the hot breakroom and put this cake together. It was fun and it was beautiful. Then, it began to melt. I started eating cream with a spoon, laughing the whole time. After I had four of the donuts, I decided to take it out to my co-workers. I work with all men and they found it as fantastic as I did. Everyone now knows my desire for donuts. that could be a bad thing. lol. Thank you so much for making my birthday mucho fun!!!

As the day worn on, the party at our house just kept getting bigger and bigger as more neighbours and friends kept getting invited for the BBQ dinner.  This saved the day.  I stopped at the store and bought a variety of donuts, berries and coolwhip.  The kids helped to assemble and this cake was a hit with everyone young and old.",2006-10-03

I had gotten lazy and was eating the frozen tv dinner kind this whole time which is much more expensive.  My mom always uses 3 T of flour and 3 T butter and 3 cups milk to 1 jar of dried beef so that is what I did this time.  I prefer it this way which is less thick and less chunky.  Even my 2 year old loved this.  Oh, yes, always soak with hot water a few times to get rid of most of the salt in the meat.  Then I use kitchen shears to cut the beef into pieces straight into the pan.",2009-11-30

I had people coming over and asking for the recipe. I did make a slight substitution: instead of the 1 1/2 cup rolled oats I used 3/4 Cup rolled and 3/4 cup quick. I wasn't sure I would like the texture with only rolled oats. In any case, they turned out delicious. A little on the sweet side, but I didn't hear anyone complain :)
Oh, and they did take a longer thant the 12 mins. stated baking. At least in my oven. So you might just want to keep an eye on them till you see them turn a nice golden color.",2007-05-27

From now on I will definitely be making these our family's traditional sweet potato dish at the holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's. They would be great for Easter too. They would also be great as a side for steaks and grilled chicken.  I followed recipe first time exactly, except for I used a mixture of sweet potatoes and yams to give a nice variety of color.  I also tried them without adding the brown sugar because sweet potatoes are so sweet naturally and I substituted olive oil for the butter, they came out just as tasty.  Either way these are definitely a keeper!!",2005-03-12

I baked the potatoes on a stone baking sheet, and my cooking time was approximately 25 minutes.  The potatoes were sweet, but not too sweet. These potatoes reminded me of the days when as a child my Mom and Grandmother made those delicious sweet and fried candied sweet potatoes.  I plan to use this recipe again very soon, and I'm going to sprinkle some cinnamon, all spice, and ginger in the liquid ingredients.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe :) I look forward to using it again and again.   Pat",2007-04-08

EDIT: We make this a lot -and it can be our vegetable or our starch!...We'll have chicken and rice and sweet potatoes, or more often chicken and green beans and sweet potatoes.  They're more nutritious than white potatoes, and so yummy.  2 of us eat a whole cookie sheet of wedges!",2008-01-28

295401,862530,5,1,"The best and easiest recipe for these I have found and tested!  I do add that, my personal preference, that I cook the bacon 2/3 of the way in the microwave since the bacon is raw while the peppers and cream cheese only need to warm up for effect.  Doing this to the bacon, for me, ensures that the bacon will be extra crisp AND cooked thoroughly....thanks for having such an amazing recipe and thanks to RecipeZaar for being such a great help!

I had a bit of trouble getting it to stretch over a 3 layer cake though (Rita's cake recipe # 140464 also good).  Again, I had some trouble because I think my frosting was too runny.  I know there is some chemical reaction with cooking sugar.  Do I need to stir constantly or maybe not at all?  It seemed like the mixture was really thick (but not brown) after just 5 minutes of cooking and then after that each time I would stir it would bubble up and then get more runny.  Like the mixture was breaking.  I think I will do more experimentation in the future.  Will make again.",2005-11-02

My fiance and I made it for his father for father's day and both his parents loved it!",2007-06-17
140466,493002,5,1,"Yumm! I made this for my picky daughter's b-day cake, she doesn't like frosting but she loves this.
Thanks for sharing this recipe.",2007-09-15
140466,330005,5,1,"I loved the recipe the only thing I did different was to add some gelatin to make sure it thickened and I used half granulated sugar and half brown sugar I think it gives it a more caramely taste, and it turned out beautiful.  I own a specialty cake shop and was making it for a customer and they couldn't stop raving about it.  It is very much a keeper:) Thanks so much for posting.",2008-06-07
140466,137302,5,1,"I read all the other reviews and made two changes recommended by others.  I added 1 teaspoon of cornstarch to the mixture before it was cooked.  I also used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar. The end result was wonderful.  BTW, folks remember her instructions say to cool before spreading.  This mixture thickens more as it cools.  I found that with the addition of the cornstarch it was the right amount of thickness, yet not to thick.  (I believe it is the egg yolks which do the thickening, I wonder if extra large eggs would work to make it a little thicker as well.)  I also stirred it for the entire 12 minutes which seemed to help.  I set the timer and read a novel while stirring so I didn't think about how long it took.
Thanks Rita...German Chocolate Cake and this style frosting is my very favorite.  I made it last night for my birthday.  I know...kind of awful to have to make your own cake...but if I didn't then I wouldn't have had the pleasure of eating it.",2008-10-22
140466,37636,5,1,YUMMY! I used this to make Recipe #332294 and it was fabulous. I will also enjoy using this on cupcakes and layer cake. I had no problems at all and the flavor is fantastic. Thanks for sharing. ~Sue,2008-12-30
140466,199792,5,1,"This frosting is the best ever. I didn't find it needed anything to thicken it, just patience for it to set up. It is worth the wait and then some. I think I just might be dreaming about this!! And, it is a very good thing I sent the cake home with my family or I would be into it right now. Thanks for sharing.",2010-06-01
140466,810787,4,1,"I should have read the reviews first. The taste is great but it does need to be thickened more. Next time, I think I would use it in between the layers as I did this time and put a cream cheese frosting on the outside.",2010-10-03

You only use the yolks!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I changed this a little bit and Im in heaven. I too used sweetended condensed milk instead of evaporated, and i used half brown sugar and half granulated. it cooked up in about 5 mins with my gas stove. I added in pecans and coconut and its to die for!! VERY EASY TO MAKE!!!",2013-05-10
140466,2000254196,5,1,*RECEIVED RAVE REVIEWS* I made German Chocolate Cupcakes for my nephew&#039;s open house.  I came across this recipe in my search for a filling.  The only thing I did differently was that I put 1/2 of the Coconut &amp; Pecans into a food processor and pulsed several times. I thought this would make it easier to go through the tip for filling.  I think it did somehow make the flavor even better though. :-)  Friends and family asked if I had any spare.  LOL.  This will be a keeper!!,2015-06-07
140466,1803009897,5,1,"I used sweetened condensed milk and I grated by hand a whole fresh coconut ( only needed 3/4 of that fresh coconut , what a workout ! ) and added a tsp of cornstarch . This recipe turned out perfect except too sweet for me . I think even if I would of used only the evaporated milk unsweetened it still would of tasted to me too sugary with this recipe calling for 1 1/2 cups sugar, and believe me I am not a sugar wimp , I'm a sugaraholic ! So I did the unthinkable I scraped all the frosting off the finished cake and put in a metal mesh colander and rinsed in hot tap water to wash off all the sugar then I baked my rinsed pecans and coconut to dry the water off of it and start from scratch again . I decided the sugar Amt is too much for my liking and I know u need it for the Caramelised taste so I decided to make a different frosting so I tweaked my own for my taste , 1 cup evaporated milk , 1/3 cup sugar, 2 tsps cornstarch, 3 egg yolks no egg whites, 1/2 cup butter , 1 tsp vanilla , 7 oz unsweetened coconut, 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans . Maybe this tastes more like custard frosting but it still turned out same consistency , just tasted more like coconut pecan to me without the overpowering sugar taste that makes u have a sugar rush . I still gave rita 5 stars for the cake is perfect without tweaking .",2017-02-26

104755,241579,4,1,"Not bad for a gluten free cookie.  If you think of it as a dessert, rather than the traditional chocolate chip cookie, you will not be disappointed.  I didn't have the dairy free margarine, so I subbed a little less than 1/4 c. canola oil and added a tsp. of butter extract flavoring.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of cream of tartar to help lighten the consistency of the dough.  Cooking time at 350* was 15 minutes on my oven.  Thanks for a good recipe!",2007-06-26

104755,1087826,5,1,"This was REALLY good! I modified it, and used white chocolate chunks, but otherwise I used the same recipe, and it was tasty! Making them with the tablespoon and then squishing them makes really small cookies; so if you want more than 2 1/2 dozen small cookies, I suggest doubling the recipe, cause they don't rise really at all.",2009-01-17
354032,875884,4,1,This is a delicious recipe but I would not call it a cookie.  I would call it a muffin.  it is the exact consistency and sweetness of a muffin; so if you want muffins or something to enjoy with breakfast this is perfect!  If you're expecting cookies this might miss the mark.,2009-03-09
354032,324390,5,1,"What a very special cookie! They almost look like little cakes. It has a pumpkin spice flavor and I love how the cardamom kind of trails off in the end. They would be perfect with a cup of coffee and I know my DBF is looking forward to having them for breakfast. I'm going to have to hide a few for myself. I cut the recipe in half (there are only 2 of us after all) and otherwise followed the directions as listed. I think walnuts or chopped dried pineapple would be good in these too- but to be honest, they are just perfect as they are, so why mess with perfection? Thank you chef! Edit 3/12: Today I asked DBF what he wanted me to bake for him- what ever he wanted- He requested these! (I should have known, he always wants these!) I love them too and have made them countless times this past year. Thanks Tinkerbell.",2010-03-14
288249,119228,5,1,"These r really good!  

When I put them thru my recipe builder at wwonline they came out to 1 point per cookie.  This was even after I added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips (kidâ€™s idea).  I used raisins (what I had on hand) instead of craisins.  I didnâ€™t have whole wheat flour so I used 1 1/2cups of regular flour and 1 1/2cups of natural wheat bran.  Because I was trying to figure out points I counted the servings and I came up with 64 (1 generous tablespoon each).  I  found that  I only needed to bake them for 12 minutes, different ovens I suppose. This cookie is very cake-like and something that even while trying to lose weight I feel I can enjoy as either a quick breakfast or snack.  Even my children enjoyed them.  Thanks so much for posting this fabulous recipe!",2008-02-24
288249,1347760,4,1,I was looking for a quick recipe that didn't include any butter and these were great. I used mini chocolate chips and regular flour.

It was quite different from your usual mac and cheese with the pasta being fried and all, but still had all those qualities one loves in the original: It was cheesy and very satisfying. The crunch was an extra plus.<br/>I used a herb-infused butter and a mix of gouda and swiss cheese on top, which worked out really well.<br/>Everyone really enjoyed this dish, but we all felt it could have used a bit more seasoning and also found that there wasnt enough sauce for the amount of pasta used. It was a little bit dry. But other than that it was perfect!<br/>THANKS SO MUCH for sharing your creation with us, chef and good luck in the contest.",2011-05-28

My boys and I both loved this comfort food and the crunch really gave the past a nice change in texture. I put in too much chili sauce at first (too much for the kids that is) so I toned it down with a bit of added yogurt. It was a wonderfully filling, a big hit with the kids and went in lunches the next day. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for this lovely change to regular mac & cheese. Made and enjoyed for RSC #16!

The children experienced fried ravioli in Switzerland, and so also were interested by this concept.     I did up the amount of sauce, I like a lot of sauce with my pasta,   but otherwise, as recipe,  this was really good and very much to my taste, rich and creamy with a chewy texture added by frying the pasta.   Oh, I did fry a little bacon and sprinkle on top,  just as a little added extra!  Thanks Teresa,  glad I tried this!  Made for I Recommend tag game.

383379,573325,4,1,"These cookies are very, very yummy! They have a great vanilla flavour!
I made half the recipe using real sugar (reduced to 1/4 cup) and ended up with 12 fairly big cookies.
Ive never baked cookies using only egg whites, so Im not sure if it is supposed to be like that, but my cookies were really, really chewy, I might even say rubbery. Not that they were bad or anything, just a little weird texture-wise.
My sis and me really enjoyed these and would definitely make them again!
Thanks a lot for sharing this lovely recipe with us, Stormy!

163467,77488,4,1,Instead of provolone I added Cheddar Cheese along with the Smoked Gouda.  I would also had some salt to taste.  But overall - very good.  Will make again!,2006-09-04
163467,121690,5,1,"This was delicious. I think it's the smoked gouda that makes the recipe. I wouldn't make it with a type of cheese, that has a strong taste which would compete with the gouda; the provolone was just the right choice. This is not an OVERLY salty dish, which I appreciate, but with the frozen potatoes and gouda cheese, it certainly didn't lack for saltiness.",2006-10-12
163467,199848,5,1,"I loved that smokey flavor from the smoked gouda and even from the provolone cheese.  This is fantastic and more exciting than the usual hashbrown casseroles.  My hashbrowns were the plain variety, so I added my own chopped peppers and onions.  I also used cream of potato soup.... just because I never buy cream of chicken.  This recipe is a keeper; thanx!",2007-10-16
163467,537937,5,1,"A fantastic taste of smokey goodness.  I followed your recipe as written but I can see this working equally as well with regular hashbrown potatoes for those that aren't partial to onions and peppers.  I caution reviewers to not skimp out by using something other than smoked gouda as this is what makes this potato casserole FANTASTIC.  Instead of provolone I did use shredded chedder.

Mine were golf ball size which made them very filling.  I baked 8 of the nuggets and put the other 8 in the freezer to bake later.   The taco nuggets have a nice taco flavor, loads of gooey cheese,  and the crunchy breading is truly outstanding. I personally didn't care for the honey salsa, but DH enjoyed it.

I used VERY lean beef to make them, but the fat in the co-jack cheese (and also in the Doritos, too, I think), made these very heavy with grease.  They did taste good and smelled great while cooking.  The time involved was minimal, as these were pretty quick and easy to put together; however, tacos are even quicker to make and my family said they prefer tacos over these nuggets, so I don't think I'll be making this recipe again.

They continue cooking as they cool.  And make sure you use doritoes.  Tortilla chips would not remotely be the same!

I used Vegannaise, salt and pepper, scallions and finely chopped celery and put it inside a warm whole wheat pita with lettuce and tomatoes. Delicious.

87187,394592,4,1,"This makes a lovely salad, a nice change from the expected tuna/macaroni/or slaw concoctions.  Initially  I intended to sub my own yogurt spread instead of the mayo as I usually do, however my yogurt had frozen in my ""new"" misbehaving refrigerator!!  We did have a bit of mayo that I decided to scrape together instead as the recipe originally suggested.  Now I'm glad that happened.  I was working with a 29 ounce can of garbanzos and still used about 2 tbsp of mayo, while just about doubling everything else.  The addition of the mustard and relish improved on the mayonnaise taste that I usually try to avoid -   I liked leaning a new trick!!  I rinsed the beans; processed some, hand mashed some and left some whole to achieve different textures.  I added chopped celery and chopped the onions  also to add a more varied quality of texture.  It was a quick, easy salad to throw together.  I will definitely make it again- perhaps to bring to a summer picnic-potluck type party!!  We enjoyed it over a bed of baby greens with grape tomatoes.  A very nice, new salad experience for us - THANKS.",2007-04-28

It was as fast and easy as tuna salad, without opening one of those stinky cans, and as tasty as egg salad, but without the bother of boiling eggs.  Even my 3-yr old was fooled.  Mashing canned chickpeas isn't so easy, as they are on the firm side, so I threw mine in the food processor, then scraped them into a bowl to mix in everything else.  Easy clean-up too.

I think it's more of a cross between tuna salad and egg salad than tuna alone. You can eat this on a bread, on crackers, or even on a salad, there are lots of uses for this. Great source of fiber and protein. NOTE: Make sure you rinse the chickpeas before mashing them, many canned versions (like Bush's) use a TON of salt.

I also forgot to add the salt and pepper, but did not miss them.  We ate in a lawash wrap with a fresh spinach salad on the side.  Mom asked for the recipe and I myself will be making this often.  Thanks!",2012-06-21

This does not taste like tuna to me (or what I remember of the tuna sandwiches I ate a decade ago) but my whole family finds this sandwich completely amazing. Even my pickiest eater will eat the whole sandwich! This recipe really is a wonderful base to anything you want to throw at it. My husband loves this grilled with a slice of cheese. Tomatoes, mashed avocadoes, cheese, garlic... are all good added but this recipe is also terrific without any extras.",2013-02-16

For relish I used some pickled peppers that I made almost a year ago that were languishing in my pantry.  Also, I subbed onion powder for the onions since I wanted that to be a more subtle flavor.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My apologies that this isn&#039;t a review of your exact recipe.  It was, however, simple to adjust to my own tastes (I don&#039;t think I truly measured anything) and it&#039;s something I think anyone could make &amp; enjoy.",2013-04-11

This does not taste anything like tuna, but after letting it chill overnight in the fridge, I found the next day, that this did smell a bit like tuna. When I assembled the ingredients together, first I used a potato masher to mash the chick peas, but I only used 1-(15.8 oz.) can of the chick peas. I then added 4 tablespoons of mayonnaise, 1-1/ 2 teaspoons of the spicy brown mustard, as I thought the 2 teaspoons was a bit too much, plus I added 3 tablespoons of the sweet pickle relish. I didn&#039;t have any green onions, so I just added 1 tablespoon of yellow minced onion, and I thought that was plenty of onion. I did add a dash of salt and pepper as well.

Also new for us was tossing the arugula with oil and baking it briefly (we usually put in on raw) - and this was a much nicer way to do it. I had to try one piece of proscuitto on it since you mentioned it (we became crispy proscuitto lovers after your Recipe #193399!) - but we baked it on the whole time. It was yummy both ways. I made the low fat version of this with just a little cheese and low fat ricotta. I made the roasted garlic paste the day before, so I needed to warm it up so it would spread easily. I like to use a piece of parchment paper on my pizza peel for convenience - you can stretch the dough on there, then easily slide it into the oven and bake it right on the paper.

I'm making it again tonight for chicken. Leftover pork is always horrible reheated in any way. This recipe will save a lot of pork from being thrown out as tasteless left-overs. This sauce is a keeper, exactly the way it is presented. I use Knorr chicken bullion only. It's soft enough to press into a measuring spoon. I use a garlic press for most recipes.

We found this a little bland, but it would be easy to jazz it up with some more herbs, red pepper flakes or something like cayenne pepper. I don't have a broiler pan, so I did these on a cookie sheet. Unfortunately, that made the bottoms come out a little soggy.  Next time I will put a rack on top of the cookie sheet and do them that way to keep 'em crispy.  Also, don't put any extra breading on the sheet with your scallops, it'll burn!  The breaded scallops turned golden, but any extra on my sheet turned black as can be. Thanks, I'll give these another try with a little more spice. Super easy!",2008-03-04

I gave all the scallops a healthy spritz of fresh lemon juice before doing anything else with them, I do that with almost all fish or seafood before cooking it, just a little quirk I have. We also used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the Melba toast.

I used your own light buttermilk ranch dressing recipe for this and it worked well.  I had to use wholemeal bread because sourdough is really hard to get in the UK.  I used reduced fat cheese and used my foreman grill so that I could skip buttering the bread.  That combined with using the light ranch dressing meant this wasn't high in fat or calories at all.

I cheated a bit - mainly as we were busy - by proving the dough in my mum's bread maker......and then took over for the shaping and proving by hand. We ALL loved the toasted oats and barley - that is WELL worth doing, do not skip this step! I don't use splenda, so light brown sugar was used, and only 1 tablespoon instead of two tablespoons. In place of cornmeal, we used polenta - NOT the instant type. The loaf cut well and the flavours were deep and intense - the texture was quite dense, I may cut back just a LITTLE bit on the whole wheat flour next time for a slightly lighter loaf. Annacia - we all loved this with English cheese and salad for a light supper tonight. I also cut back on the salt, as I suffer from hyper-tension (to 1 teaspoon) with NO ill effects.

I'm sure what I missed out on was the flavor from the zest of the orange, since the whole orange slices would have contributed more flavor than the mandarin segments did.

232763,67728,4,1,"This made some pretty good grilled chicken, but I do agree with the other reviewers that it comes out a little bit dry. Of course, if I had more time when I was making this, I would have brined the chicken first, since that's typically what I do with chicken breasts before I grill them anyway. I didn't have any fresh lemons to squeeze for juice, so I subbed bottled, not-from-concentrate lemon juice. For the hot chili powder, I used Recipe#116514 because none of my bottled chili powder was the hot variety. DH is pretty picky about meats on the bone, so I used boneless skinless breasts. I enjoyed the strong lemon flavor, but I think I needed a bit more salt (I prefer my grilled meats to be a little on the salty side). This made quite a bit of chicken for just two of us, so I used the leftover breasts sliced up in a big salad -- delicious! Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT4",2008-06-30

I think I was trying to compare it to the German cabbage rolls I grew up with.  I did have to use baby bellas because I couldn't find the other mushrooms.
I also couldn't find ground pork at two stores.  I ended up using boneless center cut pork chops that I ran through the food processor. I think ground chicken would be  an acceptable substitution as well.  I will be be doubling the recipe next time because there were no leftovers after the three us were done.",2013-02-22

Luckily we only ate half of it, because when I had the rest later on - it was amazing! So basically just let it sit...or have it simmer for longer on a lower heat.

311561,286566,5,1,"I loved this recipe as it was so easy to make up and quick to cook and could be prepared ahead of time.  I filled 5 1/2 dariole moulds so shortened the cooking time to 6 minutes and then let rest for 2 turned out the 1/2 one and looked really good though short with a wonderful rich dark sauce (I used a 70% cocoa chocolate) but when we upturned the first of the full ones we had a puddled mess put the other 4 back in the oven for 3 minutes and then left for a couple of minutes but still ended up with a puddles mess.  So I plan on making this again soon but will divide the mix evenly between 6 moulds and cook for the full 9 minutes. I will then rate it at that point.

I was tossing this together to use up some stuff I had in the kitchen (like the flank steak that was hogging up freezer space so my new ice cream maker bowl won't fit in there, lol), so I had to make a couple of slight changes. Some of my basil was slimy beyond hope (hate that, grr!), which only left me with about 1 1/2 cups basil, so I didn't bother frying any of it. I used Fresnos for the chiles and French green beans. No fresh gingerroot in the house, so I guesstimated and used about 2 tbs of Gourmet Garden ginger in a tube. I had plenty of fish sauce, but I forgot to pick up oyster sauce last weekend, so the closest sub I had in the house was Soy Vay Veri Veri Teriyaki sauce. I added 1 1/2 tbs of that and omitted the sugar because I didn't remember oyster sauce being sweet like teriyaki sauce. Lastly, I left out the cashews, mostly because I just didn't have any, partly because they're one of my least favorite nuts. This was simply perfect with Recipe#277122!

These meatballs were good, but I think I am used to hers :)  The gravy (or sauce as I call it) was wonderful...again, close to mom's, except this one has no salt or pepper (which I admit I thought was odd, but I didn't add it!) or cheese in it.

In a word:  YOWZA!  Just a few changes -- after sauteeing the garlic and onions in a saucepan I dumped all the sauce ingredients into my crockpot.  I made up the meatballs (without the cheese) and just plopped those right into the sauce, no browning them first.  No Italian sausage in the vicinity, so I used some hot Moroccan sausage.  I started this all early in the morning, switched the crockpot on low and went off to work, swearing all the time I could smell it cooking across town.  About 9 hours later I came home to find 2 Dornettes and various friends drooling in the living room.  It was torture waiting for the pasta to cook, but we were well rewarded with the most astounding weeknight dinner we've had in a long time.  My vegetarian Dornette practically wept with frustration, but still managed to stick to her principles in spite of the most amazing aroma coming off our dinner table.  I've got plans to double, even triple the recipe and keep batches of it in the freezer for those times when I need my fix!

We found it very tasty and satisfying served over 1 lb. of angel hair pasta...alas, my teenage son said that it didn't seem all that different (to him) from regular spaghetti sauce. I told him that this *Sunday Gravy* recipe is NOT the same as regular home made spaghetti sauce...right?  (I don't know; I need some more education in Italian cuisine.) I added a little cabernet sauvignon to the sauce and a bit of additional salt.

Very easy to do, as well, just time consuming.  I made a few changes to suit our personal tastes and what I had on hand- a combination of 2/3 beef and 1/3 sausage in the meatballs, diced tomatos instead of chopped, and I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of basil to the sauce.  I also used an immersion blender to reduce the chunkyness after removing the meats (purely a preference thing- we like smoother sauces).

But the meatballs were bland.  Tender yes, but really missed on the flavor.  I used top of the line sausage and it came out very bland & dry.  It could have been the sausage so I won't attribute it to the rating of this recipe.  I also had cut up the sausage to bite-size though the recipe doesn't state this.  I slow-cooked in crock pot which I think helped the sauce.  I may do again just for the sauce but try another recipe for the meatballs.  Thanks for posting!",2008-09-22

I had a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes with fennel and red peppers so I added that along with the paste and and crushed tomatoes. I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I used basil, anise seed, parsley, salt and pepper. I had frozen meatballs, so I used those instead of the meatball recipe (but I want to try that recipe next time I make this, I just HAD to clean out my freezer). I simmered the sauce all afternoon yesterday (Sunday, of course) and had it over spaghetti for dinner along with some garlic bread. It was so good, I'm having it for dinner again tonight.

Maybe I am used to more Italian seasonings or S/P. I don't know, but I even bought San Marzano canned tomatoes, which are supposed to be the best. It smelled wonderful while it was cooking. I used to make my own sauce from an old cookbook from the 60s and it was great. I think the meatballs were fine. I really don't care for grease floating on top of the sauce.

19078,22015,5,1,"Loved this.  I even had 2 leftover and reheated them the next day.  It was still great.  Used some of the hot sauce that I was sent in the food swap and added a little bit more than was called for, still great.  Thanks for posting it.  I never knew that I liked cooked whole tomatos before I tried this.  ",2002-09-26
19078,35965,5,1,"I've seen a couple mentions of people trying this recipe and they just raved and then I really wanted to try it.  I thought our tomatoes were done for the season and that I'd have to buy tomatoes to make it...in fact, I asked Lorac about a method she uses to improve store bought tomatoes (over in the message and thank you board) thinking I would have to try this recipe with them.  Not so...DH and I went for a walk in the yard a couple days ago and found we have a few really nice sized tomatoes that frost hasn't gotten yet and they were ripe!  since they were larger than medium size, I used 3 and kept the rest of the recipe measurements the same.  I didn't have fresh spinach, but found in a substitutions resource that beet greens can be substituted, so I headed back out to the garden and collected some of them.  This was absolutely delicious.  I shortened the baking time by about 5 minutes and the tomatoes were warmed and just slightly softened, but not cooked through.  This tasted like we were eating a BLT without the bread...yummy.  DH and I each had one and I packed the other in a lunch tray to send over to my MIL (She's 73, and a widow, so anything that I feel will reheat well, I use to make TV dinners for her to throw in the microwave).",2002-10-10
19078,29196,5,1,"I made this at work today, but I made it slightly differently-same ingredients, just a different presentation. Also multiplied the recipe by nearly 3.
I cored the tomatoes, and cut them in half (around the equator), I lay 16 halves in my baking tray, spread over half the filling mix, some cheese, then repeated all that. I then cooked them in the oven til the cheese was golden brown. Excellent.",2002-10-30
19078,80353,5,1,"Excellent recipe using up the last of our vine-ripened tomatoes.  I must confess to also adding 2 minced garlic cloves, but the combination of flavours was really wonderful!",2003-10-14
19078,157096,5,1,"This was absolutely wonderful!!  I didn't have any bacon, but I wilted the spinach in bacon grease (I'm Southern, I always have bacon grease in the frige) and you couldn't tell that there wasn't bacon in it.  Next time I will shorten the bake time so the tomato isn't so soft, but otherwise, this was a great dish.  ",2004-09-01
19078,29014,5,1,"This was indeed - heaven!  Since tomatoes are out of season here right now, I used the ripened-on-the-vine variety, and this was just awesome.  I cannot even imagine how good this will be when garden tomatoes are ready to go!  I made the recipe exactly as posted and ended up with ten small to medium stuffed tomatoes.  Bonus!:  Because there's just two of us, I had leftovers, so I chopped them up, stuffing and all, and added to homemade tomato soup - wow, TDF!!  Thanks, Lorac, for a real keeper!",2005-03-13
19078,184097,5,1,This is a wonderful recipe.  I am really learning to love lorac; you can count on her for great food.  I think this is a great side dish that is really going to spice up my recipe collection.  I had been looking for the perfect baked tomato recipe and this is it!,2005-06-16
19078,108915,5,1,"Awesome!  I used proscuitto instead of bacon, but I still used some bacon grease to sautee the onion.  Also, I sliced large tomato ""steaks"" instead of removing the centers.  Of course, this made everything really juicy, but it was so good on top of crusty bread!  There is really no substitute for fresh, farmers' market tomatoes!",2005-07-25

19078,51717,5,1,"This is a keeper. Followed the recipe exactly, except I did not top with grated cheese. This was a side to our Christmas dinner roast that also included Ultimate Scalloped Potates #42532, so there was quite enough cheese in the mix already. Our tomatoes were rather large, so I made the full recipe for the filling and had some left over. Just added that as extra topping for the last tomato to go with a ham steak a few days later.",2007-12-28

74972,85714,3,0,"I'm really riding the fence on this one.  I didn't really care for it, but hubby really liked it.  I gave it 2 stars and he gave it 4 (which is a high compliment from him because he's a harsh critic!) so I'm meeting in the middle on three.  Granted, I left out the peppers (didn't have any) and cooked it uncovered, but that's because I wanted the sauce to be thicker, and it was still quite liquidy.  I'm not sure where I might have gone wrong, I think it just wasn't to my taste.  Next time I might try it with the bottled dressing and see if that kicks it up a bit.",2004-04-06
81561,102937,5,1,"Wow!  It is simple, light and delicious!  I made it with all fresh lime juice because I prefer it over lemon.  I also used half sugar and half Splenda and it still tastes great!  Thank you Lennie for this wonderful recipe!  ",2004-05-04

180301,63858,4,1,"This was good.  My husband absolutely loved it.  The hardest problem for me was figuring out what kind of snack to add.  I couldn't think of what would be okay.  I ended up using almonds.  I almost added raisins but wasn't sure how that would be with the onion flavor.  Anyway, it probably would have been very nice.  Thanks for a nice recipe.

180301,88099,4,1,"Well at first I wasn't sure that I liked this, but after eating a couple of handfuls, yep, I do.  Really nice change for popcorn.  I used the raisins as mentioned in the other review, and it was a great choice.  The sweetness of the raisins with the onion taste was perfect.  Thanks twissis",2006-09-23

472310,369715,4,1,I had meatballs in the freezer so I did not follow this meatball recipe but I followed the rest of the recipe. I used all beef broth instead of broth and water. I also used petite diced tomatoes as that is all I had. I then used 3/4 teaspoon of italian seasoning instead of rosemary and basil. I also added a bit more spaghetti then what was called for. We all enjoyed this as it was something different. This heated up nicely the next day for lunch also.,2012-06-19
136638,72135,5,1,"what a delicious surprise.  i had a head of cauliflower to use, made this recipe, and was amazed at how tasty this healthy dish could be!  i'm not even a huge cauliflower fan and i will definitely be making this dish again in the future.

136638,1599218,5,1,"I joined this site just so I could rate this recipe. The results from this recipe are so impressive considering the simplicty of the ingredients and preparation. If that were not enough, this is so healthy! I cook this recipe on a regular basis and often crave it. I don't even like cauliflower all that much. I brought this to a dinner party and was asked for the recipe and my friends are amazing cooks, some of them culinary school graduates. Admittedly, I steam the cauliflower and garlic together by placing them in a big glass bowl with a tablespoon of water, covered with plastic wrap, and I microwave it. I don't think it hurts the results. My ""food snob"" friends who make this insists on steaming it on the stove and they add wasabi to it. I often contemplate thinning down the leftovers to make a base for a creamy soup of some sort, but there are never any leftovers!

Next time I would probably fry off some mushrooms and squeeze them in between the cheese and the egg layer,just to make it even more decadent.

228946,204024,5,1,This is delicious.  I made this using boneless skinless chicken breasts. I marinated it for 2 days.  We made this for fajitas.  We will definitely make this again. Made for Fall 2007 PAC,2007-09-29

Super flavorful and best of all, the ingredients are ones I always have on hand.  I let the rib steak marinate for a little over 24 hours and I can't wait to do it again.  Definitely a keeper for us.  Thanks for sharing!!!",2011-06-01
75097,383346,5,1,"Instead of nutmeg, I used allspice.  And a little bit more.  Me and my son loved it.  DH doesn't like tourtiere so he didn't taste it at all.  I told my mom that I made this tourtiere and she wanted the recipe.  I gave her by the phone yesterday evening and she made 5 tourtieres with your recipe.  She also used a mix of veal and pork.  She liked it.  She's used to add ketchup to a tourtiere but with this one she didn't cause it was too good.  It's really a keeper.  And very easy to do.

333921,645905,5,1,These are truly fantastic! I love how smooth the filling is as opposed to the kind of meatbally texture other dumpling recipes I have tried seem to have. The only minor change I made was to the amount of oil. If you have a really good nonastick pan you only need about a tablespoon for the entire recipe. Thank you for posting this recipe!,2009-02-10

I also added 1 or 2 tablespoons of honey to the sauce. I sauteed some veggies with soy sauce and honey and tossed those around with the chicken for the last 15 mins of cooking.

I eliminated the salt and pepper; did half brown and half white sugar; used low-sodium soy sauce; added pineapple chunks and used the juice from the pineapples.  Served with rice.  This recipe is a total hit!  I served almost 30 children, almost all had seconds and some had thirds!  Even the pickiest in the bunch had seconds!  The only thing I'd do differently next time is add some vegetables, such as steamed broccoli, peas, carrots, peppers.  This was yummy and is a definite repeat for our school's hot lunch program!",2012-10-28

YOU GREASE THE PAN!!! An idea: put the cottage cheese in your blender or food-processor to smooth it out. I made this exactly per the recipe. In the future, I would omit the bacon. This would make a great vegetarian dish (provided they eat cheese and egg) if you omit the bacon!",2007-08-21

The taste was out of this world. I used part onion powder, and garlic salt, instead of onion salt. I also used organic peppered bacon, this added a nice rounded flavor with the real bacon and potatos! This was wonderful. I served 6 adults and 3 kids with this meal. A budget friendly meal also.

I used real bacon instead of bacon bits (mixed it all in the potato mix so didn't have any for the top - OOPS!), added fresh garlic to both layers, and added an extra egg to my cottage cheese mix as mine seemed a little too liquidy.  i also didn't print out the recipe, made it from memory so the amounts were off a little but this recipe is so forgiving i don't think you can mess it up.  Next time i think i'll add some green onion to it too.  i did divide both mixtures in 1/2 and put some of both in each layer, that's how i do my regular lasagna and it just seemed strange to have separate thing in each layer - just personal preference i think.  this has been on my to-try list for over a year, now i wish i'd tried it sooner!",2008-12-01

Also, would definitely use real bacon instead of bacon bits as the red dye leached out and colored everything a horrible Pepto Bismal pink color.

I used as much bell pepper as mushroom and ham and added extra green onion.  I really enjoyed this, but next time I""ll season it a little more because it was a little bland for my taste.

234329,242809,5,1,"Everyone LOVED these! The boys said that this was the best wing recipe ever, better than my mom's 'famouse' wings. I'm very impressed with just how crispy they were, especially since they weren't fried. One thing I do not like is a soggy wing! Worked out perfectly! Thank you for a great recipe!!!",2008-02-03
234329,35701,5,1,"Wow.  I haven't been back here in ages to review a recipe, but this one is worth it.  A friend passed this along to me.  I'm not a huge fan of buffalo wings, they're usually too soggy.  But these are perfection!  I made them on Tuesday and we're still talking about how great they were.  Tossed then with the flour mixture in a ziptop bag, and chilled them in the fridge for 40 minutes, and gently dipped them in the sauce.  I didn't want to wash the flour off.  Baked for the 40 minutes, turning once.  When they came out of the oven, I took them off the foil and put them on a rack so they wouldn't get soggy on the bottom.  Absolutely perfect!  they were crispy, not soggy--just like they had been fried.  Thanks for an amazing recipe!  Now I can use these to bribe my husband, hahaha!",2008-02-21

234329,316717,5,1,omg what a find! crispy just as if you deep fried it in oil minus all the extra fat. i was craving for buffalo wings and this was perfect since it made a small amount. i love spicy and my family doesn't so i was able to make just enough for me w/ this recipe. i love how crispy it is w/out dealing w/ all the annoying oil that usually comes w/ making wings. i did have some extra flour mix and sauce left so next time i'll add more wings. this recipe will go into my favorites! thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe.,2008-03-25
234329,740247,4,1,"I made these for a football party & everyone loved them.  They were crispy & the meat fell off of the bone.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I personally like more sauce on my wings...but that just a personal preference, we all loved them!",2008-04-03
234329,109041,5,1,"These were fantastic.  The flavor was wonderful, the wings nice and crispy.  I don't know how many calories you save versus frying as you dredge the wings in butter and hot sauce, but they sure are easy to make!  As to the reviewer who knocked off a star as these wings aren't ""saucy"", well Hooters wings aren't saucy.  These were a perfect and simple duplicate.",2008-04-26
234329,661753,5,1,omg!!! these were awesome! my husband and i absolutely loved them! i personally dont like wings cause of the bones but man theses were delicious! we made 20 of them and we still wanted more so next time we will double the recipe. i took a rater's advice and let them toast on the oven rack the last 10 minutes but i didnt line the bottom of my oven with foil and needless to say i made a mess! but it was worth it and i will remember this little detail next time. thanks so much for sharing!!! its a family favorite now!,2008-05-25
234329,195589,5,1,"Yummm!! These hit the spot! I only had 1/4 cup of Frank's hot sauce, so I added 2T of worchestershire, 2T of low sodium soy sauce and 1 T of O SoVeryTeriYaki Sauce. Also added some red pepper flakes. They were so tender and juicy and they were not too hot for the little ones. Next time I will try them with the full amount of hot sauce. Thanks so much for posting!",2008-11-10
234329,246936,5,1,I thought I had already rated this. I really liked baking the wings instead of frying them. One of my boys liked them and the other did not. (He preferred the fried ones better) And my hubby loved them too. Will make again!,2008-11-13
234329,632249,4,1,"These wings have very good flavour. However, I did need to drain the grease a few times, and maybe that should be included in the directions so that people don't think you can just pop them in the oven without checking on them. (I wonder if that is why Chef #1099313 had problems with the wings being greasy.) Next time I am going to try baking the wings for 20-25 minutes with only the flour mixture on them, drain the grease, then brush on the sauce and see if they turn out to be crisper.  I will definitely make again as we really liked them. Thx Dug!",2009-01-21
234329,24386,5,1,"Awesome wings!  I used only 6 tablespoons of butter and a little over a half cup of flour and everything else as per recipe.  I was very impressed with how crusty they get due to letting them sit in the fridge with flour mixture on them.  Will cut flour amount down to half a cup next time.

234329,347909,3,0,"Sorry to rate it a 3 as the taste was good, but the temperatures and timings were not working for us.  We had to turn up the oven by 20+ degrees C and cook for an extra 30 min.  Also, not sure the coating made any difference, ie the flour mixture - a lot of it stuck to the bottom of the baking sheet.  In the end, just cooking them plain at a high temperature and then mixing in the sauce would have achieved the result.",2009-08-27
234329,76001,4,1,"I liked these wings and thought the coating made them turn out great in the oven, just like fried. I mixed the flour and spices in a big plastic bowl, added the wings and put the lid on, then shook a few times and they were all coated perfectly. Easy to dip in the sauce and easy to bake. I also lined my baking sheet w/foil. I didn't think they were too greasy and the hotness was very mild. Thanks!",2010-01-03
234329,207907,5,1,I made these the other night and they turned out great. I used chicken quarters that I skinned. I doubled the recipe and halfway through the cooking I drizzled some more hot sauce on them. They tasted great. I didn't use wings because I don't eat chicken skin and there is not enough meat on them. Thanks!,2010-04-29
234329,407007,4,1,"These were very tasty! The recipe itself was a lot of work, and as it was my first time making my wings I spent a lot of time just figuring out how to separate the wing from the drumette... (figured out kitchen scissors are the easiest way ;)) All in all with prep, fridge time, and cooking, the recipe took almost 2.5 hours. The taste was great though and DH loved them so thanks for sharing!",2010-05-31
234329,496803,4,1,"Really yummy!  I love wings but rarely want to go to the work of deep frying them.  This was a nice alternative, and saved a few calories.  I cooked them on a rack placed over a baking sheet, so that any grease would not stick to the wings.  They were very easy to make, and I'll definitely do so again!",2010-07-18
234329,1187622,3,0,"I hate to give any recipe a poor rating but this recipe just doesn't work.   First of all, I think the cookie sheets needs to be greased, my wings stuck terrible.  Then the coating and baking with the sauce turned out to be an uncrispy mess.  Even baked an additional 20 mintues at 425F.   I too agree with another reviewer that all the heat from the sauce was gone till we ate them.",2010-10-24

234329,305531,5,1,These were good. I didn't bother separating the wing tips before cooking - it was easier to do when we were eating them. My grandson loved them and added more hot sauce at the table. Thanks Dug for sharing. Made for Cookbook Tag.,2010-11-15

234329,481092,5,1,"Awesome. I made it a little easier by just tossing the wings in a ziploc bag with the flour mixture and chilling them that way (several hours ahead).  Then when ready to cook I dipped them in sauce mixture and placed on cookie sheet lined with foil and sprayed with Pam so no clean up :)  Used Frank's EXTRA Hot sauce, Yummy.",2012-11-20

234329,1803016547,1,0,I made these wings yesterday and they were terrible. Not sure how these other people can say they come out crispy!  They were soggy and most of the coating came off when baking them. I will never cook them again. I would suggest frying the wings then shake them in the sauce.,2014-08-10
234329,1803354337,4,1,"Thanks Dug, this was an awesome recipe. This too was my first time making chicken wings and they turned out great. Although I altered the recipe slightly. Made 12 wings, didnt cut em in half either. Also no flour and no butter. :) Tried to be a little less fatty, but i know now why I would do a little better next time with the flour. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also my wings didn&#039;t stick to the baking sheet (I did NOT use oil/pam/etc). I live in europe and I noticed when I was back home in KY, when I baked cookies, they stuck to the sheet. The paper I use here, nothing ever sticks, it&#039;s awesome. I can essentially keep . using the same sheet for multiple batches of cookies until the paper itself starts to turn brown, then i change of course. :D",2014-11-16

45216,37305,5,1,"This was incredible and should be called ""To Die for Roast Chicken""!  It deserves extra stars.  I used a 7.5 lb. chicken (I buy them big because we have a big family :) and doubled the stuffing.  Everything about this is great...the gravy, the stuffing and the chicken itself.  Before I had this, roast chicken was a boring meal around here.  Now I can't wait to have it again!  I never roasted a chicken with the breast down, but I think this was the reason the breast meat was so moist when it is usually dry.  I cooked it breast down for 1.5 hours and then flipped it over until it was done.  My chicken was an oven stuffer roaster with a pop-up timer and I thought it might not pop after being upside down, but it did and the chicken was done to perfection...color gorgeous and skin crispy.  The kids were not overly fond of the stuffing because of the lemon zing, but it was perfect for me and my husband.  (By the way, I did not double the lemon rind when I doubled the stuffing).  One thing that was odd...we did not taste any apple, but maybe that was just my apples (granny smith).  Oh, and for anyone who is using a bigger chicken like me, I did not double the butter that was rubbed over the chicken.  There was the perfect amount to cover and I think the butter is one of the reasons that the gravy is so good and a rich golden brown.  I cannot thank you enough for sharing this recipe, Sharon...it was just awesome!  I'll shut up now :)",2002-11-14
45216,44514,5,1,Tried this today and it was as good as it smelled baking in the oven! The skin was crispy and juicy. I think that is a good idea to bake it breast side down. I used a big roaster(6.5 lbs.). Perfect! Served it with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. Thank you for a winner!,2002-11-24
45216,54728,5,1,"Beautiful, aromatic moist roast chicken recipe - we loved the stuffing, though we didn't get the giblets with our chicken so didn't get to try the gravy. The only change I made (which I personally loved) was to substitute 1/2 a lime, rind and juice, as it was all I had...but it was perfect...seemed to complement the apple flavour (I used a Delicious, which worked for me). Oh, and I was out of butter, so used Nuttelex margarine but was still happy with the taste (though I will try butter next time).The breadcrumbs were made from our favourite homemade(BM) spelt & multigrain bread. This is definitely a keeper, and will be my recipe of choice!",2005-02-26
45216,169969,5,1,"I know roast chickens! And take it from me, this one is outstanding! Wonderful flavors and just the right amount of seasoning! The gravy is so rich and creamy!

45216,169430,5,1,"Beautiful roast chicken. Usually DH will turn his nose up at any stuffing that I add anything ""weird"" to (weird includes fruit of any kind). He said that it smelled ""really good"" while it was cooking and took a small sample of the stuffing, then went back and got a big helping. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the breast stayed moist. I loved the addition of lemon. The whole thing was so good that I even broke down and put some gravy on my stuffing. It was indeed an ideal Sunday dinner.",2007-06-11
45216,618715,5,1,"This recipe was AMAZING! It was simple to prepare. The only difficult part was flipping the bird, but we had a 7.6lb chicken so that may have been part of why. Both DB and I ate until we couldn't eat another bite. The meat was so tender and flavourful, just fell off the bone. The stuffing was also scrumptious! I can't wait to make some chicken soup with the leftovers!",2007-10-21
45216,68526,5,1,"I made this for my lunch today instead of a big meal tonight. I can't begin to tell you how juicy my 4 lb. chicken was, and I will be flipping my lil birdies upside down from now on for sure :) I loved the chicken. However, I cooked the stuffing that was outside the bird for 40 mins. and it was dry, even though I covered the casserole dish with aluminum foil. I've never made a stuffing with no liquid in it before, but wanted to follow the recipe exactly. My stuffing looks nothing like the stuffing in Karen's picture, and I followed the recipe to a T, except that I used 12 grain bread instead of white bread, and I did use an extra 1 T. of butter, because it was so dry when mixing. I wasn't crazy about the stuffing at all, but that's my personal preference I guess, so I am giving the 5 stars for the delicious moist tender chicken, and if I were rating the stuffing I would have to say 2 stars, because it was just ok, and not something I would make again.

151732,354295,5,1,"PERFECT! My husband said, ""It tastes just like chicken fried steak, and it's really, really good!"" I only had 22 saltine crackers on hand so I used 16 ritz crackers along with them. Also, no peanut oil on hand so I used canola. I'd like to try it with the peanut oil in the future to taste the difference. Either way, it turned out excellent and the gravy was awesome!",2009-01-09
151732,1135399,5,1,"Made it with Venison for a girl who says whe hates deer meat and would not eat it.  I made it for her anyway, and she said it was the best chicken fry she had ever eaten!",2009-01-18

151732,783601,5,1,"Great recipe! I was only going to eat half of the large steak I made, but it was soo good I ended up taking a few bites out of the other half!! I'm excited for the leftovers tomorrow.",2009-03-12
151732,126440,5,1,I made half a recipe and served it with garlic mashed potatoes and Recipe #26110.  Great meal.,2009-03-30
151732,1319385,5,1,My wife and I just made this and we both enjoyed it tremendously!  For those that aren't aware of how to get your stove top to 360 - set it between Medium and Medium High heat settings.  This is Perfect!,2009-07-09
151732,177753,5,1,"This was super easy to make and turned out really well. The crust actually stayed on the steak, which I've had a hard time with in the past. The gravy was also delicious and I dare say even better then next day! Thanks, this one's a keeper!",2009-08-10
151732,161282,5,1,"Sooooo Good! Been on a chicken-fried steak kick since having it at a restaurant. This would also be excellent served on buttermilk biscuits as a hearty country breakfast with  hashbrowns, eggs, and fruit. Not one for leftovers, this tasted even better the next day! I prefer cube steaks to the sirloin or other steak some recipes call for because the texture adds to the rustic, down home appeal of the dish. This is a keeper!",2009-09-07
151732,50969,4,1,"This was made on 10/04/09, for mine and SO's dinner. And since the was just the two of us, I did make a few changes that I don't think affected the finished product. Here they are,for the  steaks I used pork cube steaks ( that's just a personal choice ).  This is what was done for the coating,3/4 cup of crushed crackers, 1/2 cup flour, upped the red pepper to 3/4 teaspoon, 1/4 teaspoon baking powder. For the egg mixture, 1 egg and 1/2 cup milk was used. For the frying part, 1/3 cup of canola oil was used in a heavy skillet. After cooking the steaks, all but about 2 Tblsp. of oil was drained off and 1/8 cup of flour was stirred into the oil and lightly browned. Then I added the milk just a little at a time, until it was the desired consistency. I think about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of milk was used. The steaks had a very good flavor. And we really enjoyed the gravy over the steaks, buscuits and mashed potatoes. This will be made again. Thank you for posting and "" Keep Smiling :)  """,2009-10-05
151732,178427,5,1,We really enjoyed this. The only thing I did different was to use less oil for frying. I loved how the coating stuck to the meat and how the meat looked and tasted. The gravy was super and made a lot. I have enough for biscuits and gravy tomorrow. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.,2009-10-27
151732,622972,5,1,This was so yummy!  I used Canola instead of Peanut oil simply because that is what I had.  For the gravy I just used enough milk to get the right consistency.  It had a great flavor.,2009-11-02
151732,755277,5,1,"I used about 1 cup of canola oil instead of peanut oil and it turned out great. Also added some garlic powder to the flour mixture for the steaks. Cooked in my cast iron skillet. Turned out perfect! Served with homemade biscuits (Recipe #77417 by Hag Chef), mashed potatoes and corn. Thanks for sharing!",2009-11-22
151732,130531,5,1,"This must be a 5-star recipe, DH ate his and the extra helping without uttering a word !  I too served this with mashed potatoes and corn. 
I used 2 c. milk and 1 1/2 c. of the potato water for the gravy. I did have to add more seasoning to the gravy but we like it peppery!
I have never used cracker crumbs with the flour for this dish, and it was nice and crispy, just the way it is served in restaurants. Very good.  Donna",2010-03-12
151732,116371,5,1,This was a different dinner for us as we usually don't eat fried food.  I made mashed potatoes and green beans with it and my family loved it - especially with the gravy.  This is a keeper!,2010-04-02
151732,84830,5,1,"I've never been able to get a good-tasting, crunchy crust on chicken-fried steak with the usual flour-only and egg wash preparation.  This recipe has fixed that!  I whirred all the dry ingredients in my food processer for easy cracker crushing and to incorporate the spices and baking powder evenly. The crackers and baking powder did the job.  Good, crisp well-seasoned crust which doesn't fall off the steak before it's out of the pan.  I did not use all the oil it called for.  About 1/4 cup oil worked perfectly for me.  This is the recipe I've been wanting for 40 years.",2010-05-08
151732,355637,5,1,Yum!!,2010-10-11
151732,206779,5,1,"I have never made a good chicken fried steak until now! This recipe is amazing! Simple ingredients and amazing flavor. The delicious, crispy breading did not fall off of the steaks. I have never made milk gravy using this method, but this will be the only way I make it from now on.  The gravy was delicious and smooth.  Thank you Kathy for sharing a recipe that we enjoyed so much and will continue to enjoy!",2011-04-07
151732,350577,5,1,"This was very good.  Everyone ate the entire steak.  I didn't have saltines so I used half Panko and half Ritz crackers.  I also had no baking powder (cooking at a friends house makes things harder) so I used some pancake mix in lue of about half the flour since I know there is some added in there already.  I also added garlic powder to the flour mix. I will make sure that my oil is hot hot before starting to fry next time, I think mine wasn't quite there but that's my fault.  It still came out amazing despite all this.  I added a lot more pepper to my gravy and probably salt too, personal preference.  I had never had chicken fried steak myself, but the other two eaters had.  Yum!  Served with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.",2011-07-31
151732,837451,5,1,Delicious! I have also cooked pork chops this way. Thanks for posting!,2011-09-13
151732,578731,5,1,"Kathy, thanks so much, your recipe is very similar to the one my mom made and I&#039;ve been making for years. My husband is Italian and he wanted me to put Italian seasoned bread crumbs on.....no way!!

151732,2329244,5,1,"My husband said &quot;we&#039;re never going out for fried steak again!&quot; We really, really like this recipe.

151732,1939035,3,0,"As is needs some changes but easily fixed. The meat itself was good. I liked the crumb crust, came out well. Although I only needed about half the egg wash.... Had a lot leftover. My issues were more with the gravy. First the meat is salted and peppered then there is a lot of s and p in the sauce. It&#039;s too much, can&#039;t taste the meat anymore. I cut the s and p in the gravy in half. And the amount of gravy: made twice what is needed as well. Since we had a lot of leftover gravy.... I tossed some dried beef in it to make creamed chipped beef on toast for breakfast the next day.",2014-06-05
151732,1802849661,5,1,"Admitting something super embarrassing here; until this, I'd never tried chicken fried steak!!! I always wondered what the fuss was about... well now I know!! This is fantastic! Loved the crumb coating and it was really easy to make. Meat turned out lovely and moist. We served ours with fine beans and mash and then I made mine swim in that luscious gravy!",2017-05-02
151732,2001023362,5,1,Phenomenal! The only thing I did differently was to refrigerate the dredged steaks on a rack for an hour (or two since I got busy with the darn lawn mower...but i digress). Let them sit for 20 min. on the counter while the oil heated.. I use the same method with fried chicken or fried pork chops and all turns out perfectly every time!,2018-06-28
369745,733775,5,1,"I made this last night, when I only had 1 chicken breast. I made small little cakes and they served 4 perfectly (with vegetable sides, of course). I used canned chipotle, but I only had one. Next time I will use more, as I like things very spicy. Really great recipe!!!",2009-08-16
501705,88099,4,1,"Nice cake.  I had never had a peanut butter chocolate chip cake before and we liked it.  I think I added too much glaze as it was very, very sweet after adding it.  I was not sure what kind of cake pan to use but a 9x13 worked just fine.  For the glaze I used butter, coffee and chocolate chips that may be why it was so sweet.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Spring PAC 2014",2014-04-13
320341,227586,5,1,"Yum!  This was a very good cofee cake, though I did half the recipe and made them into muffins.  I got 8 regular sized muffins.  I also used ground hazelnut for the topping and it came out great!  The sweetness level was right on and I loved the low amount of fat (oil).

Thanks for sharing, Glaucia!!",2008-09-28
320341,705251,4,1,A very nice coffee cake.  I did adjust it by using chopped almonds in place of the walnuts for the topping.  I used plain yogurt in place of the buttermilk also as you stated as an alternative.  I really liked the flavors with the wheat flour and the blueberries (used fresh).  Thanks for sharing!

472184,2001546492,5,1,"I love this concept especially the poblano pepper, and used it for a base as well as reviewing the original recipe. My tweaks to personalize were to use 1/2 shiitakes and 1/2 oyster mushrooms (both organic), a small bunch of local baby spring onions as well as the leek and 1 large vidalia onion, used napa cabbage, and added 1 lb carrots (from original recipe). I roasted all the veggies except the tomatoes and cabbage with a spray of canola oil at 425&deg; for about 40 minutes before putting them in the stock pot with the cabbage, tomatoes and water. Finally I agree that lipton onion soup and canned beef broth are gross but I added 3 organic beef marrow bones (roasted first and poured off fat) which added richness I love in traditional cabbage soup without the excess sodium and additives and only about 10-15 calories per serving. My recipe builder calculated this at 78 calories/serving assuming 24 servings. Cheated with a little tequila on day 1 and a glass of wine on day 2 (agave and grapes, right?) so I skipped the baked potato, but doesn't seem to have sabotaged anything because I'm down 3.5 lbs as of the morning of day 3. Also exercising 30 minutes/day.",2018-04-27
116961,1004235,5,1,"This came out wonderful. I tweaked it a little. I added two large minced garlic cloves instead of one, and almost a full tbsp of ginger and honey.  I broiled the halibut on a broiling pan, but I lined the top of the pan with foil and made a little bowl with 1/4"" sides to allow for a bit of the marinate to broil with it. I also buttered the bottom of the foil and put about 1 tbsp of butter bits on top of the fish to help it cook. Finally I poured a little bit of the marinade inside the foil bowl I made and broiled it as recommended.  My wife and I loved it! Thx for posting!",2009-06-28

I left out the red pepper & cayenne for the kids, and then instead of freezing, placed them on a cookie sheet, brushed them with oil and cooked them on the grill for a few minutes, flipping once.

242943,209603,3,0,this had a real odd taste.. i think from the celery and it was also a little watery so i added about 1/4 cup salsa and some sour cream and put it in the oven until it was bubbly and thicker and hot (about 30 in or so) .. and sprinkled cheese on top and melted that.. then it was good. i also added a jalepeno for heat and after all the adjustments it was A LOT better maybe almost a 5 star.. but i would omit the celery the next time.. thanks though it turned out good and was eaten with pleasure!,2007-09-14

However, I did use a little less tahini (about 100ml) than indicated and quite a bit less olive oil (about 50ml). Maybe my eggplants were smaller than the ones used in the original recipe, but I just found that the end product was so creamy it didn't need the full amount of either ingredient.",2002-07-14

I grilled the eggplants on the bbq which lent a wonderful, smokey flavour to the dish. Made the recipe as directed but I added 2 tsp. of sesame oil at the end which gave it just a little punch that I felt it was missing. It is really crucial to do a thorough job of draining the bitter juices because it can wreck the dish and leave a horrible aftertaste. Thanks for this authentic and easy recipe!",2003-12-14

I have bought this in the store and it is either mainly mayonaise (yuk) or has a chemically, fake tasting smokey flavor. I served it to the old school italians in my family and said it was roast eggplant dip. (they would not have touched baba ghannouj ;) They ate the whole bowl with toasted pita chips.

Just WAY too much sodium for my tastes!  I followed the recipe, but since I do not like canned mushrooms, I sauteed fresh ones in butter, with the cut chicken and a bit of onion.It turned out really well, and I will be making this again.

It was a good comfort food kind of meal, minus the usual fat and calories.  I served with green beans and biscuits.  I baked for half an hour, stirred, and then left the cover off for another 40 minutes before the liquid was pretty well absorbed.  Next time I might reduce the liquid a little, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. Very good, a definite keeper in my book!",2007-05-30
54800,187281,3,0,"We liked this one but didn't love it.  It was rather light for evening meal even with bread.  My family said they still felt a bit hungry afterwards.  It also didn't have alot of flavor so I added poultry seasoning, paprika, salt and course ground pepper and cooked for another 20 minutes because it was still had too much liquid.  I think this would be a good dish to use with leftovers or during Thanksgiving when you have too much turkey leftover.",2007-06-15
54800,185305,3,0,"We liked this casserole, even my casserole-averse husband. As others have said it needs spicing up and has to cook longer than the directions say. 

I increased the oven temperature to 375 and it did reduce the time somewhat. After 50 minutes I uncovered the dish and let it back another 20 minutes. At that point it was close enough to done that I put the cover back on and turned off the oven while I microwaved some broccoli. It was nicely cooked.

I added a heaping tablespoon of Bell's poultry seasoning to the dish but it still needed more spice. I'm going to add paprika to the leftovers to see how they taste.

Next time I think I'll skip the Uncle Ben's and use regular wild rice with my own spices. If I get it worked out, I'll be back with an update.",2008-01-13

That said, creaminess is good for a vegan mac & ""cheese."". I urge cutting turmeric in half (too yellow at posted dose, and the taste is too pronounced).  Do not skimp on pasta, err toward more.  Taste is missing something... Maybe purÃ©e some onion & garlic?  Also, too much tahini... maybe down 1/4th?

As is is not for company, but a strong foundation.",2009-01-25
221169,1164754,3,0,"I live around the corner from the Soul Veg restaurant and this is definitely not the recipe they use. I would recommend not only cutting the tumeric in half but toasting (30s on a hot, dry skillet--taken off the heat) it lightly to get rid of some of the strong flavor. I added 1/4 cup of soymilk to the final mixture. Instead of just salt, I used VegeSalt and ground black pepper. Also, this is the soul food version of mac and chees that's more like a casserole than the Kraft version. If you're not used to that, you won't understand the texture difference.",2009-02-10

452129,169430,4,1,I made a half recipe for 6 lovely scones. The pecans I added into the dough instead of putting them just on top for personal preference and used Splenda Brown for the sugar. The single thing I would do differently is to double the banana or use really big ones. With just one in the half amount the banana flavor just didn't come through all that well. That said I realize that we're nor making banana bread with this recipe but more banana flavor would have been nice. The recipe works beautifully and bakes up with nice crust and a light texture inside. I loved them for breakfast very warm from the oven with Recipe #456068 this morning.,2011-08-15

I made this exactly as stated and it was just the right amount of heat for me.  Easy to put together if you use a food processor to mince the onion.  I had this with baked tortilla strips, as a dip.  What little was left over went into some soup to kick it up a bit.  Very versatile and delicious.  Thanks for sharing this one, Sue!",2005-12-09

This comes as a condiment with the thali I get at a local Indian kitchen and I fell in love with it even though I usually need to put the fire out with a mouthful of yogurt. And now I can make it at home, quite quickly, and without as much of a bite! Instead of mincing, I sliced the onion, but followed the rest of the recipe precisely.  This is fantastic, Sue, thank you so much!",2007-03-16

Tip:  unroll the cooled cake (make sure it's cooled or it could crack) onto a large piece of plastic wrap or wax paper for easier rolling and storage.

To us the amount of thyme was too strong,so the next time this is made I'm cutting it down to 1/8 teaspoon. I don't think my changes affected the final outcome of this recipe.

25648,1563156,4,1,"These are delicious!  I must admit, though, that I made several modifications to the recipe as posted.  Here are my changes:  I used softened cream cheese in place of the butter, I used garlic, thyme & rosemary in place of the parsley, and I added mushrooms & shredded asiago cheese. I pulsed the mushrooms & onions in a food processor, then sauteed them in a little butter w/ the garlic, thyme & rosemary.  After they had cooled, I combined them with the softened cream cheese, crumbled bacon, & asiago cheese. Instead of creating pinwheels, I simply spread the mixture generously on half of the crescent-roll-triangles, then topped with the remaining triangles.  I baked at 375 until golden (about 12 min), let everything cool for a few minutes, then cut each large triangles into 3 smaller triangles, arranged, & served.  There's the pizzazz another reviewer was looking for!  The resulting complexity of flavor stood up quite well to the crescent-roll dough.  With my changes, the recipe made 24 instead of 32 servings.",2011-09-02
154147,169430,3,0,I made this to go with chicken and it was very good on the whole. Next time I make it I'll leave out the tomato's as they just seemed out of place in this dish. Other than color I really don't think they added anything to compliment their neighbors. All of the other ingredints worked very well together and made a tasty and quick veggie dish. In place of the tomato's I very well might add some cashews. I'm glad that I tried this.,2007-03-02
154147,177435,4,1,I made this for ZWT4. It is better to make this with fresh asparagus. Next time I will add garlic and gingeroot to give a little flavor. I will also leave out the tomato. That being said everyone still cleared their plates.,2008-05-25
154147,193516,4,1,"Unlike the other reviewers I thought the tomatoes were the best part! I liked the different texture and sweetness it brought.

I scaled this recipe back for two and we enjoyed these yummy chops with bmcnichol's Recipe #281758 and Katzen's Recipe #209425. lazyme, old-fashioned Australians - or perhaps I should say the stereotypical Aussie ;) - might describe these chops as ""beaut"" (short for beautiful) or ""bloody marvellous"", but I've never actually met anyone who speaks like that, only come across them on stage or in films! :) Most Australians if they enjoyed these would describe them exactly as you did: ""delicious""! And in modern Australia, with so many non-Australian born Australians speaking a multitude of other languages, I'm sure that there would be many words from many, many languages completely unknown to me used to describe them. Lamb chops are certainly very popular here. A Korean-born Australian 12 year old boy recently told me that he loves Australia Day because ""you get to eat BBQd lamb chops on Australia Day"". These were great made these on the stovetop, but I'm sure that they would be even more delicious BBQd. Thanks for sharing this recipe, **Jubes**. Made for ZWT 5.",2009-05-13

It turns out the lamb here is like the beef - tough. However, this recipe came out the most tender and the flavor was out of this world. I would like to try this again and increase the marinating time or add something that would tenderize a bit more.  Maybe papaya or kiwi?  But that is just because the meat is not very good here.

Using a mixture of cutlets & chops (definitely in an amt greater than 4 portions), I made the marinade in a bowl, added the lamb & made sure it was well-coated as you directed. Then I dumped the mixture (marinade & meat) into my crockpot & cooked them together for 8 hrs on high, adding carrots at the ""half"". The lamb & carrots were very tender & well-flavoured, but I wasn't done. I used a rubber spatula to loosen the cooking ""remnants"", strained the crockpot liquid, returned it to the crockpot & added cous cous to absorb the luscious liquid.

When I made this soup I wasn't sure what amount is a large can so I used 2 - 15oz cans of stewed tomatoes. I also wasn't sure what was meant by brown beans so I figured any brown looking bean would do. Since I was using stewed tomatoes I usecd 2 - 15oz cans of pork n beans. I thought this was pretty bland so I added 1/2 tbl Splenda brown sugar, black pepper, and garlic powder. This did improve the flavor.

Mine don&#039;t look at all picture perfect... but our 1 yr old grandson &quot;oogled&quot; at them from below the counter top as Nana Rosie was trying to get a clear, bright photo, and then he devoured them as soon as I clicked the photo. The first 5 ingredients on the list are what I normally use in my deviled eggs (usually along with some minced up onion and soft bacon bits). So I used onion slices for the ears. I wish I would have had capers on hand for the eyes and nose, but I didn&#039;t so I had to improvise. (Eeewww, the thought of using mini chocolate chips in a deviled egg just made me shiver!) I used diced carrots for the nose and chives for the whiskers (no celery on hand either). On half of them I used bacon bits for the eyes (since I mix them into it anyways) and the rest of them I used diced jalapeno (hubby likes hot stuff). I will definitely be making this again for Easter. I&#039;m even trying to brainstorm as to how I could make half of them look like baby chicks (maybe &quot;fluffier&quot; with a nicely carved carrot beak and celery heart leaves for feet protruding out?).

Anyhow, I really loved it, I'll definitely be making it again. Thanks!!!",2009-07-27

376844,28177,5,1,"OMG!  This is an amazingly flavorful salad!  I followed the recipe to make one serving;  using marinated artichokes, the kalamata olives & since I had a few feta crumbles to use up too, I threw those in as well.  I had fresh parsley but had to use dried oregano. To serve, I layered a plate with a bed of iceberg lettuce, a few fresh basil leaves for color contrast, sliced roma tomato & the salad.  I wish I could attest to how good it is the next day, but I ate the whole thing!  Will definitely make more next time & eat it for several lunches or snacks.  I think my family would eat it if I used black olives instead of the kalamata, but I really liked the flavor of them so I'll make both versions next time.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful surprise of a recipe, Sharon!  You never disappoint!    Made & enjoyed for your Fall 2009/week 5 Football Pool win!  :)",2009-10-14

Since your intro allowed for chg&#039;ing the fruit &amp; DH is diet-restricted from raisins, I opted to use sml bits of well-drained pineapple &amp; the flavor was outstanding! I had to cook it about 10 min more than stated to be comfortable that it was fully set -- A more shallow baking dish may have reduced the cook time or perhaps the pineapple added extra moisture. I dusted it w/powdered sugar &amp; used fresh mint from my SIL&#039;s garden as a garnish. Thx for sharing this lovely dessert recipe w/us. :-)",2013-08-04

It's easy to make, takes some time to prepare the sambal ( would say the prep time is more like an hour, with gathering all the ingredients, processing and then simmering the sambal and making the marinade for the shrimp, but the marinade for the shrimp was great. There was plenty of the sambal, too. I put the shrimp on bamboo skewers which I have soaked in water for 30 minutes. I used veined peeled tail-on shrimp which I bought frozen.

I used skinless chicken leg quarters, started in a 375 oven for 30 minutes then turned up the oven to 425 for an additional 20 minutes and the chicken turned out perfectly, moist and flavorful.

The photos I took were not good, because the light was fading and the marinade was shiny! Please mix the marinade ingredients exactly as Evelyn said. It makes a delightful marinade which becomes a dark, flavourful sauce. (I put the rest in a little bowl so we could ladle it over the cut-up chicken). A word of caution: cover the chicken with a piece of tented foil for part of the roasting time, as the marinade can burn. (The dark bits in my photo's are not burnt: it was merely difficult lighting). And there is a reason why she says to cover the roasting pan with foil ... I did not, and put the chicken in a white oven dish ... and the dish then needed soaking and a good scrubbing! This recipe is highly recommended! Thanks, Evelyn!",2007-02-02
67498,119984,5,1,This is simply wonderful!  I used a 7 lb. Oven Stuffer and didn't need to change the amount of the ingredients at all.  The marinade ladled over the chicken slices was absolutely delicious.  I didn't notice the advice to use tinfoil in the pan but used a white oval Corning dish and had no problem.  This is definitely a keeper.,2007-02-14
67498,366048,5,1,"EXCELLENT! I did not need the foil tent. Turning the chicken after 30 min. & the fact my chicken was small it cooked quickly & did not burn (kept an eye on it though when basting). It tasted great marinated 4hrs only will try 24hrs next time. Delicious, thanks!!",2007-06-04

They both devoured the chicken asking for more.  The one thing I did leave out was the hot chilli paste due to two young palates.  Instead, I mixed some hot chilli sauce into the leftover marinade after the chicken had cooked.  I marinaded a whole chicken overnight and served with pumpkin fritters, sweet potatoe and a large green salad.",2010-03-01

I tied the legs and placed the chicken on a roasting rack.  I did follow the advice and lined the roasting pan with foil.  Glad I did because it made quite a mess.  I used a slow roasting method and was very happy with the results.  The chicken had a yummy, sticky finish.  I served it with rice and with stir-fried jicama and edamame.

It gave this dish such a wonderful flavor.  I do have to say though that I didn't serve mine immediatly.  I let it sit for about 10 min. and let the ingredients marry with the pasta water and thicken up a bit.  All my water was sitting at the bottom when I first added it but did thicken up nicely.

Later I added some sriracha to the sauce and that made it more interesting for my palate - like a spicy Japanese mayo with scallion/cilantro. Maybe next time I'll try half with black and half with white sesame just for fun.

By the way the amount of sauce is enough for 10 pounds of shrimp.",2009-06-05

I put in 2 T sherry when I was saute-ing the onions, and that gave some wonderful flavor too.  I used peanut oil to prevent sticking.  Veggies release water when cooked, so I had to drain the pan.  I cooked the fish (i used a thick slab of salmon) separately on a stove-top grill, putting a cover on it because the outside was done before the inside.  I then added the veggies and heated through.

Near the end, the sauce looked a little thin, so I added some grated parmesan and melted it into the sauce to thicken.  It was just perfect.  Using 2 lbs shrimp and 16 oz pasta made ample for my group!  Highly recommended - served with green salad and ciabatta bread.  Yum!",2005-08-14

107882,36739,5,1,"We all love this salad.  I have found it to be quite versatile - we do not usually have celery in the summertime (strictly a winter veggie), so I have added various veggies to replace it, including chopped roasted red pepper and pickled veggies (jarred).  Sometimes I make my own mayo (aioli as we love garlic) in which case I don't add the extra vinegar.  This time (the third time of making) I chopped up a couple of anchovies and a tablespoon of capers and added in step 5.  I only had 1 cup of aioli, which didn't seem to moisten the salad enough, so added some extra low calorie Hellmanns with the vinegar to cut the sweetness of the mayo, which we don't like.

If you happen to have rice vinegar on hand, I recommend it over cider vinegar.

I really liked the subtle touch that the Ouzo gave -- I don't normally like anything that tastes like anise/black licorice. You could detect a flavor from the Ouzo, but it was light enough that the cookies didn't taste like anise at all.

I didn't make the &quot;full&quot; recipe as I forgot to buy whipped cream and had a different size in my freezer. Also I'd mistakenly picked up a can of pineapple tidbits instead of crushed - so that's what I used. Also since my hubby is diabetic I left out the sweetened condensed milk - I felt it was sweet enough without it. The last thing I did I read in a review on here....added a touch of coconut. I was told that I could add more of that (I didn't add much - again due to hubby). The end result....Well, let's just say I returned home with an empty dish to put in the dishwasher! I'll definitely be making it again...not only to &quot;take&quot; but for a quick dessert at home. Thanks.",2018-05-21

I then put the two mixes, macaroni and cheese mix together and baked it for about 20 minutes at 425 uncovered.

I like to have a little mustard kick in it so I'll usually add some ground mustard powder.  Or, if I'm using leftoever ham I'll also add the leftover sweet mustard sauce that I serve with my ham.  This gives the dish a nice sweet & savory taste which I love.  I also like to add some bacon because everything is better with bacon!  I've never had a problem making this recipe.  Mix the butter with the flour until a paste forms, then add the milk and whisk until it thickens (it will become noticeably thicker), then I add the cheese until it melts, then I add everything else.  I don't remove it from the heat as the recipe calls for...I leave it cooking until it is all mixed together and that 1/2 c. of cheese has melted on the top.

So I added extra lemon extract in the crust.  This turned out tangy and sweet, but not overly, which IMO lots of citrus baked goods are.  I enjoyed the lower fat content because lemon/lime squares can be extremely high in fat.  
  The only thing I didn't like was the streusel topping.  It just crumbled off and made a mess all over the counter and floor.  Even though, I will make this again making sure to try with the fresh juice and zest.

A word about the sodium count: the recipe calls for 2 Tbs salt--which is 6 tsps. Since table salt contains 6,162 mg sodium per tsp, 2 Tbs = 36,972 mg, or 9,243 mg per serving. This means that the salt BY ITSELF would contain considerably more sodium content than is shown in the Nutrition estimate for the WHOLE DISH found next to the recipe. My doctor would call this a BIG no-no. Since this is a well spiced recipe, I omitted the 2 Tbs salt and also used a low-sodium commercial chicken stock and still found it plenty flavorful, served over jasmine rice.",2007-05-28
207048,358513,4,1,"I know everyone makes variations of this and the beef one but I felt the recipe need a bit of tweaking. I used beef stew meat and dry rubbed on the curry powder (I don't measure but I think I used more curry pwd than listed),salt and pepper. Then I lightly browned them in olive oil in a dutch oven pot and added in the the onions to soften,low sodium chicken stock,garlic,can of diced tomatoes and water. I skipped the coriander because it was already in the curry powder. I added a drop of Harissa in place of the Tabasco (I'm a bit of a hot sauce connoisseur and I don't feel Tabasco goes well with NAME cooking). Added juice of 1/2 of lemon for acid and freshness. Used Allspice in place of the cloves.  I popped it in the oven and added more water as I went but the beef just wasnt' falling apart like it should. After awhile I took out the meat and cut into smaller pieces and returned it to the oven. It still wasn't falling apart so i returned it to the stove top and covered for 30 mins before serving.I was late to start dinner so I thought this would be a good recipe since it says 1 hour @500 degrees. Normally this type of beef or lamb needs to cook slowly on lower heat for  at least 3hours +. I also waited til the last 5 mins to add the peas so they wouldn't be overcooked. The end result was really good and hubby said it tasted just like his moms but better so I can be happy with that. Overall a nice recipe with needed changes and lower heat and longer cooking time.

The dough did not look good.  It was in small chunks- not at all what I expected.  I added a little water and used the mixer to incorporate it so that I could roll it out.  I thought it tasted okay.  We'll stick with our chebe bread mix for crusts.",2009-09-26
379635,1605809,5,1,"Okay, so I read Lexington6933's review and anticipated having to add more water to this as my machine was making it. Indeed, I ended up adding a cup of warm water as my mixer was kneading. Of course, that turned out to be a bit too much so I added about 1/2 cup of Bettie Hagman's four flour blend (note to self - next time add the water gradually!). Anyways, for all that, the dough was still a little sticky but it held together quite well. I used oiled fingers to flatten the dough on PAM sprayed parchment paper then filled it with what I had at the time [bacon and mozzarella cheese]. I can not believe how good this crust is!  It is chewy, crunchy and flavorful ... all things I thought I would have to give up [like my beloved Guinness...]. If you are going to try this, I recommend watching the knead cycle and pour in warm water in small quantities until the dough holds together but isn't sticky.

I know how to make potato salad!"" -- please reconsider and try this. The first time out, I followed the recipe exactly; the second time I fine-tuned it to my preferences (which include adding chopped radishes, using green onion instead of regular onion, and adding way more chopped hard-boiled egg). Both times I used regular Hellmans mayo. As some reviewers have noted, this leans towards the sweet rather than the tangy, but I didn't find it overly sweet at all. This suits my tastes, I guess.

The only problem I had was, when I added the eggs to the hot liquid,the whites cooked immediately and it looked like half done scrambled eggs. I just strained the dressing,put it back in the pan and cooked and stirred it a few minutes more, and it was fine.

Once combined, the potato salad seemed to have too much sauce, so I boiled up a few new potatoes that I had on hand and added them.  I would say that I used more like 7 cups of cubed potatoes.  I also subbed green onions for the onion, and  also had the eggs ""cook"" on me when I first started combining the sauce.  I just scooped out the larger chunks and kept on cooking!",2005-07-11

126884,1677099,4,1,This was a real surprise for me....really coconut and banana with chicken...curry and cream.....it all works together very well.  I used Recipe #424976 for the garam marsala.....I just ratcheted the recipe down to a very small amount.  This is easy to make and quite tasty.  I served it over rice.  Squeezing the lime on top really makes a difference!  Try this one.,2011-08-08
98315,593927,4,1,This was ok I did reduce the allspice by half. It may be better with the full amount? I omitted the prunes as I didn't have any on hand. I served this with Recipe #103812 warm.,2010-02-12

Easy to put together, and had everything right in the cupboard. Easy to follow directions to lead to a bute of a Mac&Cheese. I followed the recipe as written and had it in the oven bubbling away in less time then it takes to put together the Bechamel method. Sauce came out perfectly not to thick or thin, although I halved this recipe. I added 2 % reduced fat cheese, and regular breadcrumbs mixed with Italian seasonings. Great for a evening when children have activities, or freezing for later in the week. Next time I might add some Tabasco, because we just happen to adore the kick. Thanks so much! Will make again.",2007-09-13

I drained my yogurt for about 20 minutes and I'm certain that not only helped the texture of the custard, but kept the crust from turning damp. I used blackberries but am certain any type berry would do and am looking forward to trying them all.  Thanks for an unusal and tasty variation on dessert.",2005-08-10

42798,65056,5,1,"Yum.  Very tender and almost flakey with good apple flavor.  Sauteeing the apples was a really neat touch- it made them melt much more into the scones, rather than having bits of apple.  I made a couple subs and used whole wheat pastry flour and sucanat instead of sugar, which worked well.  I was a little worried because the dough seemed kind of dry, but they turned out lovely.  Not particularly moist, but more pastry like and tender.  We enjoyed them plain, but I think they would be good with some butter and cinnamon-sugar or jam or apple butter even.  Easy to make and very tender.  Next time I might experiment with adding a little cinnamon, but I think they're wonderful as-is.  ",2005-05-27

I didn't give it 5 stars, as I would have like more tomato taste to it. I also felt that the work involved called for something a tad more special taste-wise.

I had to use vintage cheddar instead of swiss (the swiss had disappeared - I think to DS's stomach).  We put the cheese over the chops and put them in a low oven (75C) while making the sauce for the cheese to melt.  Will make again but maybe not while the DH is present.  Thank you KLBoyle.

The mushrooms soaked up the flavor of the vermouth and tasted wonderful. This is a great mushroom lovers recipe. Thanks for posting. :)",2008-12-10
192214,280271,5,1,Loved this! I would suggest that you put the chops in a warm oven while preparing the mushrooms. Our chops were on the cold side but the flavor was wonderful.

4826,329756,4,1,"I am French Canadian from Lake St-John in the Quebec Province.  Finally, this is an authentic tourtiere--not like the ones I read previously. Most of the time people  send their recipe for Meat Pie and they call it Tourtiere.   My recipe is similar to yours, except I use chicken instead of duck and I  mix the diced potatoes with the meat mixture before leaving it in the fridge overnight. I also cover the bottom AND sides of a large, deep pot with the pastry and cover the mixture with a top pastry then seal the edges. Don't forget to make slits in top pasty for steam to escape.  If you don't have a cover for the pot, use aluminum foil.  The rest of the recipe is pretty much like mine.  My German and American friends  still demand that I cook this recipe whenever I receive them--any time of the year.  I didn't try yours, but it is so similar to mine that it must be as good.

WOW...in flavour its fantatsic...I love it!
This was quite the adventure for me...first time ever making caramel sauce.It took a good 15 minutes to get the sugar and water to turn to caramel but it was worth all the fretting I did. LOL I recommend any first timers to make sure your pot is big enough as the cream and coffee foam up quite a bit when added.",2009-01-06

I didn't have a stale loaf of french bread so I bought a fresh one, crumbled it up, and toasted in oven @170 degrees for ~15 mins to make it ""stale"". I added butter in step 4 and cooked at medium high heat. Couldn't get the sugar to brown properly until I did so and it made a nice toffee flavor instead of caramel.

Will certainly make this again and again!!! The only changes I made was dicing the loaf into small chunks. I also added about 1 tsp of cinnamon to the milk, cream and liqueur mixture. Instead of using a 13 x 9 pan, I used a 9 x 9 casserole dish and baked it about 10 mins longer. <br/><br/>Also, I'm not quite sure what the lemon juice is needed for, as I really couldn't taste it in the sauce. So I would think it's suffice to say it will turn out fine without it.<br/><br/>This is a great recipe, and will try it again, but replace the irish cream with rum or bourbon, just to experiment.",2011-11-10
171905,86318,5,1,"These are a surprise! And very good, too. I did a double-take when I saw the title of the recipe. On reading it, however, I decided they were more like crustless quiches than muffins. To me, quiches with tuna sound more appetizing, somehow. They are easy to make. I made one third of the recipe here and fillied 12 paper-lined muffin cups, that hold a little more than 1/4 cup each. If I had filled them to the top, I would have gotten 11, but spread things out a little, and got 12. I baked them at 190 degrees (I started at the recipe&#039;s 200 degrees, but the tops seemed to be browning too quickly,) for about 20 minutes. They came out of the papers very easily, and are very tasty with the sweet chili sauce. Thank you very much for sharing this interesting recipe with us. Oh, I didn&#039;t have quite enough tuna, so made up the difference with crab. That was the only change I made.",2014-02-22

That was haute cuisine a la 1960's.

But the easy way to do it is to toast whole slices of bread, and make as told in this recipe. Tastes the same either way. I vote lazy.

I have 5 siblings, and we all love to make this sandwich. Next generation is being indoctrinated as we speak.

DH grilled the eggplant, which was fantastic--my favorite part of the pizza.  I thought the eggplant went well with the goat cheese and parm.  I had the same reaction as you did to the pesto.  I tried spreading it under the eggplant, but it was still overpowering and detracted from the taste. I would omit it next time.

For even more cheesy goodness, flatten into a rectangle, lay on some shredded cheese and roll up to form loaves.   I think I will do that next time, so that the loaf has a swirl in it.

198069,124945,4,1,We really liked this. I took  Meezer Girls suggestion and used regular double pie crust. It did have to bake abit longer for me as I had my oven temp set to low. I only used 1 large onion and 1 tsp salt. I think I will add a small amount of sugar next time to cut the bite of the tomato paste. My husband and I agree that the sausage needs to be between nickle and quarter size or the tomato taste is the main flavor. Very quick and easy! Thanks for posting!,2007-08-10
198069,269891,5,1,So YUMMY! I've made this several times and is one of my favorite things to make for flavor and ease. I don't add the salt because the sausage and tomato paste provide enough.

I tried another test and it was wonderful.

144380,187927,5,1,"Simply wonderful! I made a double batch using about 6 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breasts (I really hate dealing with bones and such). After simmering them in a seasoned veggie broth -- I did not use the bouquet garni -- I shredded the chicken and kept it in the fridge overnight. I made the sauce as directed, using two jalapeno peppers (all I had on hand); out of deference for my guests' tastes, I de-seeded one pepper and partially de-seeded the other to keep the heat down. Next time, I'll increase the heat, since I think it would have made this great dish even better. I *did* add about 1/2 teaspoon (for the double batch) of garlic salt, as I felt the flavor was a little flat and we like a lot of garlic anyway. When the sauce was done, I threw it and the chicken into my crock pot and let it simmer for a few hours until my guests were ready to eat. Served over rice cooked in the leftover chicken broth, this was a HUGE hit.

I don't have a bread machine, and this is only the second time I've ever tried to make a yeast bread, so I was pleased with the fact that the dough/bread came out successfully. The non-bread machine instructions are a bit scant here, so you do need to at least know how to ""make bread"" to proceed. I kneaded the dough for about 5-8 minutes after adding in the flour and oil (not exactly sure) and then left it to rise in the kitchen covered with a loose piece of plastic wrap for about 45 minutes. Then I stretched and patted it into a rectangular cookie pan with dimensions about 12 by 8 and let it rise again for almost 30 minutes. I used the Herby Topping with fresh herbs and lots of garlic, and also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top. Oh, and I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of all purpose flour. It did rise nicely and was soft inside, crispy outside, and had a good texture. I think it does need some herbs mixed into the dough, though.

I made this as directed except I accidentally added too much provolone (1/3 lb) and the biggest wrappers I could find were about 6-inches so I split the filling 6 ways intead, but it was really good anyway.

I add fried onions and mushrooms to mine and it makes the rolls that much tastier. Also, this may be obvious, but make sure to soak the rice paper according to the directions before trying to use them. YUM!!!<br/>UPDATE: I only use 2-3 egg yolks, so you don't need to crack that many eggs. Also, if you mix a little mayo in with the dipping sauce, it makes it creamy and not so strong. And, I cheat and use SteakUms (probably not as good, but a little less work). Next time, I'm going to try to cook these in the oven...<br/>UPDATE AGAIN: I baked these at 425 degrees F: 15 minutes on one side--flip--10 minutes on the other. Just don't try to flip them before they're ready (they'll stick). Worked like a charm!!",2012-05-08

158382,512309,4,1,"I made this for our seder this year, intrigued by the cherries.  I love the cherry-almond combination.
This is a delicious charoset, but in my opinion the cherries got lost.  I mostly tasted apples and cinnamon, which was fine, but I didn't get the cherry-almond flavor as predominant.  I used jarred dark sweet cherries that were in light syrup, and I used the cherry liquid in place of sweet wine.  I used Gala apples.
The next time I make this (for tonight's seder, perhaps?) I will use only one apple, and will add in at least 1/2 cup of dried sour cherries, and will add more liquid from the cherry jar if needed to balance the dried sour cherries.  For those who are making this outside of Passover, I could see adding a few drops of almond extract to boost the almond flavor, too.
Thanks, Oolala, and Chag Sameah!",2008-04-20

Now I am marinating it in the refrigerator today and will serve it tomorrow at Passover dinner. After a day of marinating, I&#039;m sure the flavor will be even more amazing. I used tart red cherries in the recipe and reserved some whole ones to garnish the top of the Charoset...it looks beautiful. I did not use wine for moisture...I used a tablespoon of the cherry water reserved from my can of red tart cherries and an extra tablespoon of pure vanilla extract and this worked very well.

I also ignored all the portions and just went by taste, I loved it, but my flatmates who do quite alright with indian food apparently can't handle spicy liquids...   :<",2009-08-17
324429,1013537,5,1,Excellent Dish.  Adding vinegar to the Kim Chee added to the flavor.  I added miso paste.,2009-09-12

324429,973339,5,1,I LOVE the tuna version of this(I am currently living in Korea and you are totally right about the Kimchi needing to be older)! It is amazing that i found the recipe. I recently made it with a korean friend but couldn't remember how much of everything to put in. Fantastic job! It truly is the best food I have had in a really long time.,2010-01-16
324429,416758,5,1,"This is SO This recipe can be easily adjusted to fit your taste. For instance, next time I will ditch the mushrooms, double the tofu and ditch the meat. We try to eat vegetarian but I was afraid the soup would lack in flavor without meat - I don't think that's the case! Careful with the seasoning - you can always add more to your bowl if you like it spicier than the rest of your family. This was super easy and I will make it often. I used bottled kimchi but next time I think I'll try making my own. Very inexpensive recipe that I feel could easily be frozen. I agree that serving this with a side of rice was the perfect way to cool down. Thanks!!",2010-03-14
324429,1179803,5,1,Excellent!! I loved this soup and will definitely make it all the time now that I am making kimchi at home. I think I ended up tripling or quadrupling (!!) the recipe because I was serving a few people and I wanted leftovers. The only thing I did differently was using half of the red chili flakes and no paste because I didn't have it on hand. I didn't know how hot would be too hot for some people so I thought it would be best to let them make it spicier if they wanted to. It turned out sooo good!! I definitely recommend this soup.,2010-12-02

This was perfect! Fantastic recipe!,2011-01-08

I used a lesser amount of kimchee (homemade, extremely spicy, and very sour at three months old) made from Chinese cabbage, Korean coarse sea salt, daikon, Korean coarse dry red chili flakes, ginger root, fish sauce, scallions and lots of garlic).  Instead of pork, I made a broth using about a tablespoon of dry, granular, Korean fish base which is similar to Japanese bonito flakes except much more concentrated.  I slowly stewed the kimchee in this broth using twice the amount of garlic called for in the recipe and a small amount of sesame oil, a teaspoon or so of Thai fish sauce, and some shallot when the kimchi was stewed enough.  I put two handfuls of Korean rice cakes (a refrigerated rice product cut into coin-shapes available at Korean foodstores) into the rather thin broth and cooked according to package directions.  Extremely hot (due to my extra spicy kimchi), sour, wonderful.",2011-03-16

Here in Hawaii, we eat lots of kimchee and tofu, so i added extra in the soup. I also added some bean thread noodles for my kids. These noodles fatten up in the soup, so cook them separately and add them to your bowl instead of the pot.

The dipping sauce had a mixed reaction from forget (expected that one) to absolutely marvelous (expected that one too) and that was using low sodium soy - yes the salt love thought great and the non salter was hummm.

Followed your recipe right on down, & did use the juice from a nicely ripe lemon, which cut the tartness just enough for us!

14928,2001558315,4,1,"I tried this recipe because I forgot to start my usual overnight French toast last night. So I quickly searched an oven-baked French toast and found this one. I skimmed through the other reviews first and I read a lot that it was a bit bland. So I used this recipe as a base but added more to it. Instead of just milk, I used 3/4 C of half &amp; half and 1/4 C of milk. I added a dash of nutmeg for more flavor. And I added 1/2 C of maple syrup to the mixture for more flavor. I didn't even see the part about adding powdered sugar to the mix, so I didn't. When I tried to soften the butter in the microwave, it ended up melting which was fine. I just used a spoon to pour the melted butter over the bread and it worked out well. I buttered the bread first then dipped it in the mixture. We used Texas Toast. It only covered about 8 pieces of bread for us but that's fine because we aren't a big family. I didn't bother moving the oven racks. And I didn't use a cookie sheet because that's dumb, and you'll end up with black bread. Instead, I used a glass baking dish and sprayed it with nonstick spray before adding the bread. I had some left over butter so I poured it over the top of the bread after it was all set. I did follow the directions and baked it at 425 degrees but it took a little longer than 15 minutes. I just watched it carefully until it turned golden brown. Good base recipe! But definitely needs to be tweaked to your own taste. And don't use metal cookie sheets. Use a baking dish and spray it first.",2017-05-28

233162,121852,4,1,Good advice for novices. I live in Virginia and get outstanding fresh shrimp and other seafood sold out of coolers along the roadside. The best thing to look for there is a business license and a BOH health cert. Also open the bag and smell it. If it's fishy it's not fresh it should smell like the sea and tiger shrimp have black stripes that are not an idication that they are bad.,2007-07-28
233162,62264,5,1,"Nice advice from both ""food"" & ""greffete"" - we also are blessed with lots of local ocean-caught & river-caught shrimp in the summer. We buy from small local fishmongers & from the side of the road - look at your fresh shrimp - no pink, orange or red colors, please! These will inevitably smell ""fishy"" of amines associated with decomposition. Look for dark browns, blues & greens in the shells of river-caught & lighter shades in ocean-caught. Smell them! Anything other than a fresh whiff of saltwater - pass 'em by! Take them home quick - in a cooler w/ice or in a bag of ice. Cook 'em soon - wait no more than a day, unless you want to use them as bait. You will see them ""pink up"" as they age, even though they have not been cooked - then comes the smell (remember with bait shrimp - even the fish prefer them fresh! LOL!)",2007-08-02

I am sick of them now :). But I will say, they were pretty easy to make and tasted good. They were also very cheap for me to make since I had pretty much everything already on hand to make them. I think they cost about 5 cents a cookie to make. And, once I got the hang of the recipe, I was able to make them very quickly. The only modification I made was to roll the dough into balls which I then rolled in sugar and flattened into discs. I found this to be much easier than rolling the dough out. I am curious to see what they would taste like if the cookie dough was modified and orange juice was used in the glaze instead of lemon. I definitely plan to try that out sometime.

I substituted Herbox Sodium Free Chicken broth for the reduced sodium stock and used regular soy sauce. It was just right. I thought the broccoli was too crunchy for my taste so the second time I steamed it for 2 minutes before adding to the olive oil and garlic. I also thickened it with 1 tsp cornstarch at the end.

You can easily pan fry the chicken for a few minutes first, then put your broccoli & garlic in for a few more minutes, and then finally mix in the sauce, then cover and simmer for a few minutes.  Saves time, and I'd imagine it doesn't affect the outcome at all.  I also cut the amount of broccoli in half and added 2 cups of mushrooms instead, and I added chopped chives, parsley, & a tablespoon of cornstarch to the sauce.",2012-07-24

I agree with other reviewers who said that the directions to make this meal are a bit time-consuming, so I did tweak that. Here&#039;s how I made this: I cut 1 lb. of chicken breast into bite-sized pieces and seasoned with salt, black pepper, paprika and garlic powder. I then fried the chicken pieces in olive oil in a large skillet. While the chicken cooked, I heated two 10 oz. containers of frozen chopped broccoli in the microwave, then added the broccoli to the chicken. I then added 1/2 a cup of vegetable stock. I didn&#039;t have soy sauce so I added A-1 sauce for the tang. (It worked.) I didn&#039;t have Dijon so I added spicy brown mustard. I then covered the skillet and heated for 10 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally. I disagree with other reviewers who said the dish was too watery and needed cornstarch to thicken. I served this meal over white rice. My husband loved this meal but thought it needed some heat, so he sprinkled hot red pepper flakes on his portion. This recipe is a keeper!",2014-11-12

After fixing it, I have to say that it wasn&#039;t half bad by any stretch of the imagination.  I would have liked for the flavor to have gotten deeper into the broccoli, but it made the chicken absolutely awesome!

The directions were pretty straight forward, and the dish wasn&#039;t hard to fix.  I scaled it up and have a lunch for tomorrow loaded with protein, low in carbs and fat, and fairly tasty.

Cooking the cranberries first is brilliant and I really think that single step is what really this recipe special.

266605,606850,5,1,"What I actually made is Family Fun's ""Balls of Energy"" recipe at http://familyfun.go.com/recipes/balls-of-energy-687869/ .  Since a small banana is about 1/2 cup mashed, I love that the recipe is so simple: 1/2 cup each of mashed banana, wheat germ, and peanut butter!  It's a no-brainer to scale up or down.<br/><br/>I used less wheat germ: 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup.<br/>I used natural peanut butter, and I think it would be more fun with more peanut chunks (so I recommend chunky over creamy, unless you prefer that smooth, boring texture).<br/>I did not use any Splenda or sugar, but since I only use over-ripe bananas (my kids go through phases of loving bananas, and then that phase turns off abruptly leaving me with going-black bananas) and those have a higher sugar content, I'm sure the extra banana ripeness helps not needing sugar.  If I used bananas that were not almost-gone, I think I would want to add sweetness too!<br/><br/>I rolled some of the balls in mini chocolate chips, and some in coarsely chopped peanuts.  Both are good!  Both at the same time is good!  Mix it up!  If I had used chunkier peanut butter, I would stick with just chocolate chips for the rolling.  I stored these balls in the freezer in an airtight container, and they kept well.<br/><br/>Originally I thought this was a 4-star recipe.  It tastes OK, but we weren't jumping up and down for joy either.  I usually grab two when I have the munchies watching TV before bed (which doesn't happen often).  However, I noticed DH would always steal my second one that wasn't in my mouth, then go to the freezer to bring back two more for us.  We *have* to share, and we *have* to have more than one each.  (They're kinda filling to eat many more than two at a time!)  It satisfies the munchies without being too sweet, we keep going back for more ... that's not a ""mostly maybe"" recipe, it's actually a keeper!<br/><br/>Kid-friendly to make and eat!  My picky eater, age 5, won't eat them (no shock, since most ""composite"" foods are anathema), but once the energy balls are soft and defrosted, my good eater, age 2, will plow them down.",2010-08-24

56155,86318,5,1,"This turned out utterly delicious the second time around. Part of the trouble was that though I&#039;m used to baking bread, I tend to approach it from the point of using a fixed amount of liquid to a variable amount of flour. Here the flour is all mixed up first, then the liquid is added. I was afraid to add too much more liquid, so I got overly dense bread that didn&#039;t rise (only one loaf, I froze the rest of the dough for reworking later). I suppose if I had increased the liquid considerably, it would have worked, but I didn&#039;t want to stray too far from the recipe. This time, I rearranged the recipe to be easy for me, with liquid, yeast, sugar, other ingredients, then part of the flour. I think my cornmeal and brown rice were dry, and needed more water. This time, because I added the liquid first, I ended up using only 5 1/3 cups of white flour. I didn&#039;t glaze the loaves or bother with seeds. I got 2 loaves of 700 grams each and one small loaf of 315 grams. But what beautiful bread this is - soft and tender. I&#039;m very happy with it and will use this recipe again. I also increased the salt by 1 teaspoon, though with the reduced flour, I don&#039;t think it was necessary. Oh, and used oat, rather than wheat, bran. Thank you for posting this recipe.",2014-01-12

75429,536962,5,1,"I didn't have regular ranch mix so I used the Fiesta Ranch dip mix that I had (by Hidden Valley).  It was awesome.  My husband doesn't like chicken and he said he liked that chicken as much as it was possible for him to like chicken.  Bergy, I have to tell you, your recipes are the reason I joined the site.  Love 'em.  Thanks!",2007-07-13
75429,198129,5,1,"This is a great little recipe for when I don't feel like going to a lot of trouble. Being the only meat eater in my house, I like to buy 2 small packages of drumsticks, shake them up in the mixture, divide by individual servings  and freeze in plastic freezer bags. They can go straight from the freezer and into the oven, & it just takes maybe 10-15 extra minutes for them to cook up (And theres no breading wasted).",2008-11-11
75429,161282,5,1,"I can't WAIT to make this again! I used two big bone-in breasts and subbed 1/3 cup of panko for the bread crumbs. I also sprayed the tops with a little cooking spray. We ended up devouring chicken that was crunchy and a gorgeous golden brown on the outside, and wonderfully moist and juicy on the inside. It would likely be equally delicious served cold. Maybe the best part is that with a recipe such as this, there's no need to fry. Thanks, Bergy! And my waistline thanks you too!",2011-10-01

236407,1317239,4,1,I will totally make this recipe again! I didn't have green onions so I just omitted. I was out of green pepper so I substituted roasted red pepper from the jar. I used all of the jalapeno seeds and next time I will only use half.,2010-11-22

95311,59288,5,1,"These noodles turned out awesome! my littles loved helping me make them with my 10 year old pasta maker that i've used maybe half a dozen times, and every scrap was eaten up - -with five children, probably i should double it... i just tossed it with a canned tomato sauce, lots of parmesan, and served with a salad and i think garlic biscuits - making it for dinner guests tonight :)

DH even loved them and he tought it was a silly thing to do when I started because he said he's never had homemade noodles that were good before. But he liked thses so much that he suggested  I should try to bring it up in polite conversation with his grandma. ;) lol Thanks for helping to make my first homemade noodes such a success.,2006-06-11
95311,1152927,5,1,"These were very good! I used them in recipe #103799, and good as that was, the noodles is what I wanted more of. My only question is the proper method and time of storing them...",2009-06-11

I saved all the juice from the crockpot after I removed the chicken and the bones. Then I added 3 cans of chicken broth to the juice and boiled the noodles in it on the stove. After the noodles were done, I dumped in the chicken and served over lots of mashed potatoes! Everyone raved over it for days! Thank you so much for your recipe!",2006-10-08
95311,21399,5,1,I made these to go with my favorite comfort food of all time.  Chicken and noodles.  I left them kind of thick because I like them a little chewy.  I had bought a store rottisorie chicken the night before and used the carcass to make one of the most delicious stocks I have ever made.  I used some of the cooled broth instead of water in the noodles.  They were delicious. I look forward to making them often.  Thank you for posting your recipe.,2006-11-06

I've been making my own pasta dough for years (without the mixer), and I have never seen such a silky smooth egg based dough. It's beautiful, pliable, and brilliantly easy to work with.

My family went wild when I finally learned to make homemade noodles thanks to this recipe. You must try if you have never made good noodles or never made noodles at all. A*****,2007-05-06
95311,648343,5,1,I have brought noodles to our family Thanksgiving dinner (40 relatives) for the past 5 or so years.  I have tried a few different recipes and really haven't seen much of a difference.  When I made your great grandma's recipe I got rave reviews. They were wonderful!  The only alteration I made was that I made your recipe in my food processor as I saw in another Zaar recipe. I also use my pasta machine to cut noodles.  I also cooked in chicken broth and always add extra flour to thicken. I will use again next Thanksgiving. Thanks!!!!!!!,2007-11-26
95311,332281,5,1,"This was my very first attempt at making homeade noodles. The dough was really easy to work with but the cutting method used in the recipe didn't work well for me.

95311,323249,5,1,Great recipe! This was my first time ever to make homemade noodles. I live in Scotland now and you can not get Reames noodles (which I always used in the states) anywhere here and my family was begging for chicken and noodles. My son has now said this is the only way I can make chicken and noodles.  Thanks again for a great recipe that I will use from now on.  Cheers!!,2007-12-24
95311,739381,5,1,I rolled these with my pasta maker cut the noodles wide for egg noodles with a pizza cutter I will never ever use store bought egg noodles again  they are easy and well worth the time and effort was thinking of making these for tuna casserole,2008-01-24

OH MY!!  Thanks so much for posting this...we will continue to make for many years to come!",2008-02-22
95311,788585,5,1,I had no idea what I was doing while making these. I let them dry stuck them in a container and cooked them the next day. I was hoping that when I threw them into the boiling water that they didn't turn into a flour glob. LOL They turned out great with no previous noodle making experience this recipe is for anyone. They tasted fabulous. I put them into a garlic vegetable sauce. YUMMY,2008-05-19
95311,794578,5,1,"Excellent Noodles! I used my KA to mix the dough (beautiful dough), but I'll have to admit I had issues trying to wrap the dough around the rolling pin and then ""slip it out"" LOL I just cut them flat using a sharp knife and a flexible cutting board as a straight edge.  This was my first time making a noodle of any sort, the though never occurred to me until I ran out! Thanks for the awesome noodle recipe kindcook!",2008-08-29

95311,164645,5,1,"These had great flavor!  I actually cooked them shortly after making them, and they were fabulous.

The only thing I didn't do very well was roll them THIN enough. You really do need to make them super super thin!  They 'plump up' a bit when they cook, so they were pretty thick.  I also needed to cut them into shorter lengths (kept sliding off the spoon).  But definitely will do again!",2008-10-13
95311,256021,5,1,i made these the other night to serve with beef stroganoff.  they were amazing.  i made sure i rolled them out super thin so it took a while but was totally worth it.  thanks for this recipe!,2008-10-24

95311,67499,5,1,"This recipe was so easy, but is is important to roll them super thin. They are very light with a  great flavor. The only change I made was 1 tsp. of salt. I will definitely make these again for Christmas. Thanks for a great recipe.",2008-11-22
95311,891697,5,1,"My first try at homemade noodles.  DS9 said they were the best he ever had.  Following the advice of a friend, I used chicken broth in place of the water.  Very delicious.  Thanks, Kindcook!",2008-12-28
95311,555966,5,1,"OMG!! Are you sure we aren't kin? These taste just like my grandma's egg noodles. Not only are they the best comfort food, but they are so tender, too.

95311,1170127,5,1,"These are exactly like my grandmother made.  
She always added a few drops of yellow food coloring to the chicken broth to fool everybody into thinking the broth was richer.  It works too.",2009-02-14
95311,55523,5,1,"This is the way my family has always made noodles.  I always end up having to add a bit more water when I make mine, I'm not sure if it has to do with the egg size I use or what, but at least another 2 T of water is always needed in mine.  I urge everyone to try this recipe.  The dough is super easy to work with, the noodles come out beautiful and taste so much better than store bought.  It might sound intensive to a beginner, but I promise it isn't!  Thanks for posting this fabulous recipe!",2009-02-24
95311,1196075,5,1,"This recipe made some really good noodles for my chicken noodle soup we ate today.  I used my KitchenAid stand mixer to do all the mixing (flat beater) and kneading (dough hook) and it worked really well.  After I rolled the dough out, I left it in a rectangle and used my pastry wheel roller to cut the noodles to make them look really pretty .  I did not dry them either, but instead dropped them into my hot chicken broth, along with some cooked onions and carrots that were cut up and sautÃ©ed in butter until tender earlier.  Then I added some cut up cooked chicken breasts and mixed that in as the noodles continued to cook in with the broth.  The soup was nice and thick and the noodles tasted wonderful!  Thank you for posting this recipe kindcook!",2009-03-08
95311,645114,5,1,I made these today to go in my chicken noodle soup. They are great and now that I have found a noodle recipe that I like I will use it from now on. This was the first time I have made noodles in over 20 yrs and back then I did not like the way they turned out but that was a different recipe too,2009-03-12
95311,1040507,5,1,"This was my first attempt at making noodles for a pasta dish.  I used 3/4 cup pea flour in place of some of the flour (split peas ground into a flour).

My husband was really happy with it and thought it was a wonderful way to eat his peas. He said I could buy a pasta maker now.  :)",2009-05-08
95311,496862,4,1,"I made these several weeks ago and I really liked them. Sorry I am just now rating this!  They were easy, but slightly time-consuming.

Thanks for the recipe!",2009-05-22
95311,1276275,5,1,"Very good noodles! I added some Mrs. Dash and used the bread machine on the dough cycle to knead it. Do be careful when adding the water, it's easy to overdo it.

95311,1056692,4,1,"These tasted ok, but didn't really work out for me.  Might have been the humidity today, which was thru the roof...  They stuck together in the water when I was boiling them, even when I stirred them to try to break them up.  I also rolled them as thin as I could (need a pasta roller) and they puffed up more like dumplings when I was looking for a noodle.  Next time I'm making chicken and dumplings these will be a great go-to recipe.  Thanks anyway.",2009-09-09
95311,159863,5,1,Wonderful recipe. Just like my Mom's recipe. I made these with self-rising flour and cut the noodles wide. They puffed up and made great homemade chicken & noodles! thanks!,2009-10-04

95311,282379,5,1,"Super easy, and makes plenty. Like others here, I mixed everything in my Kitchen Aid. I ran them through my noodle machine, as the dough was not sticky and was easy-to-handle. I used to buy Reames noodles for my chicken and noodles as they were cheap and a huge time saver. However, I had to draw the line and make my own rather than pay nearly $4 a bag!

I've been buying frozen noodles forever, as does everyone else I know.  From now on, I will only make them myself.

I ended up adding just over 1/4 cup of flour a teaspoon at a time.  Perhaps it is the weather.  I did finally get it to a workable texture.  I will make them again but save some time by adding more flour up front.  Another option may be to reduce the water.,2010-01-14

95311,300721,5,1,"Very simple.  If you are using a KitchenAid pasta appliance, make sure the dough is not sticky AT ALL.

We doubled batch so they'd have some to take for lunch @ school.  Very easy and the kids enjoyed rolling out the dough.  Pizza slicer is definitely the way to go. Used one batch immediately and let the other dry overnight.,2011-04-17

95311,1701315,5,1,"DH asks for homemade noodles every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas as that's what his family always had growing up.  I'd never been brave enough to try making them until  this year.  I found this recipe that sounded exactly like the one his grandma uses, so I gave it a go. These were not at all difficult to make, even if they were time consuming.  I look at it as a labor of love :)  I dried them for 2 hours then refrigerated them overnight which worked very well.  I then simmered them in some homemade turkey stock for about an hour. DH said they were perfection!",2011-11-25
95311,357723,5,1,"I made these twice now to rave reviews! Excellent, no fail recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It's made homemade soups just THAT much better! :) The only change I make is that I do not dry these. I put them right in the boiling pot of soup and cook them through (about 10 minutes or so). EXCELLENT!",2011-12-18
95311,2223740,1,0,Not good. Too many eggs use 1 or 2 only. Bad texture.,2012-03-28
95311,288985,5,1,"I rolled these noodles out into two different sizes, a thick fettuccine and a very delicate linguine type of noodle. I cut the fettuccine on the table after rolling it out, but rolled the linguine sheet into a cylinder before slicing it into strips. The strips of pasta can then be pulled very thin whilst unrolling them to dry. <br/>This made enough for 3 separate meals (w/ some leftovers) for two, and they freeze. Very good recipe; so many types of pasta can be made - Thanks!",2012-05-01
95311,28177,5,1,"My recipe is similar, but I wanted to try yours because of the egg yolks instead of all whole eggs.  My family was nervous, but in the end they couldn't tell the difference.  I even made it all by hand, per instructions, instead of using the mixer.  :)  Thanks for sharing your recipe, kindcook.  I'll be using it again!  I used the basic method for my Recipe #280784 (Mom's Easy Chicken & Homemade Noodles) and used your noodles and Recipe #55282 (Crock Pot Chicken or Turkey Stock by Pets'R'Us).  Probably the best comfort food ever!  :)",2012-10-08
95311,1330315,5,1,Made these noodles today and used them in chicken and noodles.  I hadn't thought of using my Kitchenaid mixer to mix them up so I tried it based on other reviews.  Made it all so quick and easy!  Thanks for a great recipe.,2012-10-28
95311,68460,5,1,"These are really great noodles...making your own noodles is so satisfying!  Very good directions and do watch the addition of the water carefully as it incorporates quickly and using your hands, rather than a utensil, is a great way to go.  My noodles had a cozy yellow color due to my hens eggs, which have bright orange yolks.  I used half the batch in a homemade chicken noodle soup and the other half are in my freezer.  Thanks kindcook for sharing your Great-Grandma's recipe!",2012-11-08

95311,668077,5,1,"I wanted to make homemade noddles to add to my Grandma&#039;s (Mom&#039;s Mom) Chicken and Noodles recipe.  THESE ARE THE BEST!!!  The first time I made them, my dad said they reminded him of his mom&#039;s homemade noodles and were just as good as hers--the best compliment ever (and made me cry)!  This recipe makes a lot of noodles, too.&lt;br/&gt;One suggestion: cut the salt down to at least 1 teaspoon--any more than that makes it too salty.&lt;br/&gt;To roll the dough and to cut into strips, I have a $20 pasta roller machine from Amazon--makes perfectly thin (or thick) noodles and has fettuccine attachment that cuts the noodles into perfect width!  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!&lt;br/&gt;Note:  don&#039;t store these overnight in a plastic bag.  The noodles will soak in any flour and may become a ball of dough.  I caught mine in thine and was able to separate them in time.  Either dry the noodles completely or use immediately.",2013-03-27
95311,1795635,5,1,This was easy to make and fed thru my KitchenAid pasta press easily.  I only needed to add a little less than 1/4 cup of flour while kneading. My son loves these noodles. There was enough for soup and the rest went into the freezer.,2013-10-08

If you&#039;ve never made these noodles with farm fresh eggs, GO DO IT!!! OMG are they delicious. (Not to mention VERY yellow - the person who mentions using food coloring should switch to farm eggs. Same effect naturally.) These are so good, in fact, that I have to make a triple recipe to share with friends and family. TIP: If you make extra, after drying store them easily for 6-8 weeks in a baggie in the freezer. Keeps them fresh! THANK YOU FOR SHARING!!!",2013-11-24
95311,339260,5,1,"I took these to work for our Thanksgiving luncheon and it was a HUGE hit with everyone.  I made a triple batch of these noodles to use for chicken and noodles.  I made the noodle recipe on Sunday morning and didn&#039;t cook them until Tuesday morning.  I rolled and cut out the dough and layered them in a rectangular plastic container with sheets of wax paper between each layer and then stored them in the refrigerator until I was ready to cook them.  I boiled two pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs in chicken broth until they were done, shredded them and stored them in the refrigerator too.  Two days later, I boiled a big pot of chicken broth (I think it was approximately 60 oz.) and dropped the noodles in one at a time.  Once all the noodles were cooked I added the shredded chicken.  Then I took a 4.5 oz packed of peppered gravy, mixed it with some of the chicken broth until it was smooth and added it to the chicken and noodles to thicken up the sauce.  I put it all in my 6 quart crock pot and set it on low for 2 hours.  I took the crock pot to work and set it on warm.  The chicken and noodles sat in the crock pot from 5:00 a.m until lunch time (12:00 p.m.).  About 1 1/2 - 2 hours before serving time I moved the temperature from warm to low to heat the noodles up more.  At this time I had to add water to the noodles because they were getting a little dry.  When it was time to serve the dishes, the noodles were perfect...they did not disintergrate and get mushy...they were soft but still had a &quot;bite&quot; to them.  Everyone raved about the noodles and they were all gone except for a thin layer at the bottom of the crock pot.  TIP:  Use a plastic crock pot liner to make clean up easier.  I am making the chicken and noodles again for my family&#039;s Thanksgiving feast.  This one is definitely goiing into my keeper file.  Thanks, kindcook, for an awesome recipe!",2013-11-27
95311,1800226471,5,1,I have made this noodle recipe three times now and it is definitely a keeper!  I made home made chicken noodle soup and added these noodles to my soul and it was so unbelievably delicious!

It was a hit with the husband and my coworkers too!,2013-12-14

95311,2001264095,5,1,"This is the recipe I grew up with in Iowa. The goal was to get them as yellow (home grown egg yolks) and cut as thin as possible. My aunt was the best at that. A big bowl of rich deep yellow noodles as a side dish with every main meal. We would lay the circles of THIN dough on cotton dish cloths to partially dry, turning as needed. While still moist but not sticky, we cut them into strips as long as the desired noodle, stacked a few strips on top of each other, and cut across the stack of strips into thin (of course, wide if that's your desire) noodles. Then spread the piles out to continue drying until we cooked them. They were also stored at room temperatures for a few days. I guess that is okay, I still do it sometimes, but usually I freeze them. ( BTW, we made big batches and made an Angel Food Cake with the whites.)",2016-11-23

I didn't use pastry however, I just did the crushed biscuit and melted butter base. I also used tangelos for the juice and peel which gave a magnificent flavour and naval oranges for the pieces folded through. I made this for hubby who is not a sweets person but couldn't stop eating it (which was good as I would have eaten it all myself and become sick...) and then made it for a dinner party where it also got TOP ratings from EVERYONE, and it has now made it into my Folder of Best Recipes!

12115,31232,4,1,Very good recipe.  I left out the green pepper as well as I find it doesn't look overly appealing after a long simmering time.  I added 1 T Italian seasoning near the end as we like it a little spicier.  Next time I may substitute 1 pound of Italian sausage for one of the pounds of ground beef just to give it more zing.Overall it is a great recipe that I highly recommend.

131940,800543,5,1,Yummy!  This is a fun recipe as it's made from something we usually throw away.  Sweetie looked at me in horror when I was chopping the rind.  As the smell of the spices started filling the house he was much less horrified.  lol  The consistency is thinner than jam and thicker than syrup.  It's so good that I think it can do double duty as either one.  So far I've only eaten this on toast.  I'm anxious to try it on my homemade pecan pancakes.  Oh yes and as for Sweetie... He agrees with me that this is wonderful!  Thanks Sharon  :-),2008-09-12

120563,13483,3,0,"My muffins looked like the ones in the pic but, somehow, they just didn't have much flavour.  Not sure if I screwed up or not but I just couldn't find the taste in these.",2005-06-23
120563,350450,4,1,This recipe is great! They really are best when still warm. They taste like a slightly sweet wheat bread with raisins. I like them alot! I used 1% milk instead of skim milk and they tasted just great.,2007-03-27
120563,107583,5,1,"These had a nice crunchy outside, and not too sweet, which is the way I like them!  I subbed Splenda for the brown sugar, but used the molasses.  I skipped the raisins, but added 1/4 cup chopped dry-roasted, unsalted peanuts.  Would also be good with dried cranberries or cherries instead of raisins.  Thanks for posting this one!",2007-05-02
188041,305531,5,1,Great way to  make asparagus. Simple and tasty. The balsamic vinegar was a nice touch. Thanks Kitten for another keeper.,2006-12-01
188041,383346,5,1,"I used parmesan cheese, grated.  Maybe that's why I didn't have a crust on them.  But it's ok it was still delicious.  Delicious.  Thanks Kit :)  Made for 123 hit wonders",2008-02-18
429546,599450,4,1,"Made as directed using Puy green lentils. Lots of depth of flavors. I used my local grocer's chorizo which I'm not crazy about, so will give it another try with a more upscale brand, since I don't make chorizo myself! Thanks, katew, for a very nice supper! Made for Aussie Kiwi Recipe Swap #48, January 2011.",2011-01-17
429546,496803,4,1,"This was really yummy!  I made two small changes- I cut the oil in half, and cut my veggies finely instead of leaving them in large pieces.  My lentils took 10 minutes longer to cook than called for, but that's normal when cooking any dried legume.  The flavors were great, the spiciness of the chorizo is a very nice compliment to the lentils, and the vinegar at the end is an absolute must to give the dish a last minute bit of bright flavor.  I did question the servings you put on the recipe- I cut it in half, but still had enough for 4 servings for myself (I'm a light eater, but still, it seemed like a huge serving).  Thanks for sharing!  Made for ZWT8.",2012-07-20
483530,930260,5,1,This mix is so quick and easy and delicious! I would recommend this to anyone who likes scampi and doesn't want to spend hours preparing it.,2012-10-06
81494,303450,5,1,This chili is awesome!  I added green and red bell peppers and it was a huge hit in my house!  It will definitely be on my regular rotation now!,2007-01-10
81494,94361,5,1,"I made this recipe with a few modifications because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand. I left out the green chilis, added red, green, and yellow peppers, some carrots, and peas. I didn't have the green chilis or the corn both of which would have been great additions. However, the spice mix is lovely. The chili was superb, even with all my omissions. My very picky husband LOVED it! Thanks KMSoprano!",2004-06-30
81494,192454,5,1,"Very good! I didn't have the cannelli beans, so I used dark kidney instead (not pureed). Also, I had a frozen vegetable mix of onion and asstd bell peppers, used in place of straight onion. And 1/2 a can of tomato paste.
I know it sounds like I changed several things, but the spice combination is wonderful.",2005-05-31
81494,224740,4,1,"Turkey chili is an excellent idea, and pureeing half of the beans is a master stroke (I used chickpeas) - it makes a wonderful texture. I'm slightly weirded out by the use of cinnamon - I think that I will omit next time. Otherwise, excellent innovative recipe.",2005-08-29
81494,187935,5,1,It was fabulous.  I did not put in the corn because I forgot to buy it at the store.  I loved it without the added carbs.  ,2005-10-28
81494,63232,5,1,"This recipe is really brilliant!  I was weirded out by the cinnamon at first but decided to go for it and I'm glad I did, because it lends such an incredible flavor.  I think people are so used to seeing cinnamon used only in sweets that it seems weird when used with savory foods, but boy this chili is good!  I make it in the crockpot, just brown the turkey first and then throw all the ingredients in.  It really allows all the flavors to meld and it's so wonderful for winter!  I don't add the hot sauce, because it's already spicy enough for me, and I serve it with sour cream and shredded cheese.  This is definitely in my favorites file.",2005-12-09
81494,163833,5,1,"This was absolutely delicious! I made it with a tomato soup base and it was soooo good! I used less cinnamon than called for and maybe next time I will leave it out all together. It gave it a nice aroma with the first bite, but bite after bite the cinnamon just kept coming on too strong. I felt like I was eating dessert chili. But with sour cream and cheese this really was a wonderful winter dish.",2006-02-06
81494,163867,5,1,This is an excellent recipe for different chili taste!  I only used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and it was still plenty of smell and taste-just enough.  I also used cajun seasoning instead of hot sauce.  It was great served with Jiffy cornbread.  My DH loved it!  It was pretty spicy.  I will try only 1/2 to 2/3 of a can of RoTel next time.  Definitely a keeper!!  ,2006-02-20
81494,93417,4,1,"We all seem to be tweaking this recipe to please our own taste buds -- which makes it an almost perfect recipe for everyone!  Used kidney beans, rinsed & drained, no cannelli beans or corn, 1/4 t. cinnamon, and 6 oz. tomato paste to make a wonderful aromatic and full of flvor, fast & easy dinner for us...have added to my favorites for use again! ",2006-05-20
81494,146047,5,1,"This chili is very tasty! I omitted the cinnamon and brown sugar, and used a drained 29-oz can of diced tomatoes plus a couple tablespoons of chopped jalanpenos instead of RoTel. I adore the idea of pureeing the cannellini beans in order to thicken this up-- what a great tip! Thanks so much. ",2006-05-22
81494,320598,5,1,This recipe was really delicious.  It also freezes really well so I just make a huge vat of it and stick it in the freezer.  I did change this a little to my liking.  I substituted kidney beans for the cannellini beans and I didn't use any corn.  Instead of the brown sugar I use a natural sweetner that's called Stevia and I used only a packet of it.  It came out delicious and I'm planning on making it again.  Keep posting your great recipes and thank you!,2006-07-08
81494,318252,4,1,"I added rinsed and drained kidney beans and tomato sauce to get the color and consistency my hubby likes.  It was great topped with sliced green onions and cheese. As with most chili, even better the next day.",2006-09-11
81494,294119,5,1,"I have made your recipe twice and I love it!! This time, I just needed to use up some things in my kitchen, so I had a can of chili beans in mild sauce instead of the black beans, cannelini beans and corn and only had a can of tomato paste and a tomato cut up instead of a can of diced. I did have a can of green chiles, however. I must say, I loved it this way!! I also use a lot of spice because I love a kick! Thank you for the great recipe, it was awesome both times I made it and will be making it in the future for sure!",2006-11-28
81494,55578,5,1,"You are a smart cookie!  A great recipe in under 30 minutes!! I love the pureed step of beans as well, but my grocery store didn't have any cannellini beans so I used pinto.  Very nice flavor.  I doubled it and will put the leftovers in the freezer for another quick dinner.",2007-01-16
81494,377975,3,0,"This was pretty good and could have been great if it had any heat.
Even though I doubled the hot sauce it was still very mild. Note that the recipe does not tell you when to add the hot sauce, so I added it at the same time as the black beans. Next time I will add jalapenos and increase the chili powder. It was healthy and tasted that way!",2007-01-29
81494,88569,3,0,"This was a good hearty soup, although I don't know if I would call it a real chili.  I tried this recipe because I liked how many spices went into it, but when I taste tested towards the end of cooking it was suprisingly bland.  I had to add a good amount of hot sauce and double the cumin and chili powder before it had any flavor.  Next time I make chili, I think I will opt for a more traditional recipe, but this is still a nice healthy alternative for people willing to try something different.",2007-02-07
81494,599776,5,1,I love it!  I don't care for 'regular chili' but this is tasty and I will make it again. The only thing I did differently was add an additional cup of corn and I didn't puree the beans. The texture turned out just fine and I had one less thing to wash!  Thank you KMSoprano for this excellent recipe! I loved the cinnamon flavor!,2007-09-28
81494,750386,5,1,This was a perfect chili for a rainy day... we had it with corn bread muffins and it was a done deal.... so delicious.  The cinnamon adds a fresh new taste to chili!,2008-02-02
81494,1094567,5,1,"This Recipe is really good, I did not have the Caned beans but did have a can of hominy tasted really delicious,",2009-05-03
81494,725010,5,1,Oooo so good! Thanks!,2009-07-24
81494,1760351,5,1,Everyone LOVED this recipe. The second time I made this chili I used ground chicken and added green beans it was just as good. Can't wait to make it again.,2011-02-16
81494,1435728,5,1,This is actually really yummy! My somewhat picky husband really liked it too! I used 2 cans of Navy beans instead (1 can blended) and it still turned out delicious! I've been trying to use ground LF turkey in new ways and this is perfect. Great healthy alternative to chili. I already printed and put into my recipe book in the kitchen so I can make over again!,2011-02-19
81494,1097929,4,1,"Very good. Loved the cinnamon!  Not fond of overly spicy, so cut the heat so it had a nice bite, but was not too much.  Didn't have white beans so substituted pintos for the pureed part and added a can of rinsed/drained kidney beans with the black beans. Btw, added a little more chili powder, cumin & black pepper.  Will definitely make it again.  Thx!",2011-12-19
81494,2129918,2,0,"I did not care for this chili at all. First, a 10 ounce can of tomatoes is way way way too little for chili. I added four times that much. Also, there was not enough flavor. It's as if you had to double or triple all of the spices. The purée of a can of beans was nothing short of disgusting.  It made the chili creamy. And who wants creamy chili? I'm always on the lookout for a good turkey chili recipe, and I continue to be.",2011-12-31
81494,323690,5,1,"I loved this recipe.I tripled it right away. I mixed it up a bit,changed the beans around added a little more of the spices like KM Soparano suggested in the original write-up (""spice to taste"" is I believe what is written)...and because all I had at home was chicken boulion cubes I used three of them and added three bottles of this winter dark ale that I mistakenly bought at Christmas. It was aweful to drink but tasted fantastic in the chili.I've bookmarked the recipe with my own personal notes (chili is always a personal thing...) and I WILL make it again. Love the addition of cinnamon btw. :-)",2012-03-26
81494,2318098,4,1,Very good flavor. We modified the recipe slightly: A. Doubled diced tomatoes & green chili (2 cans instead of 1). B. Used unsalted chicken broth (instead of low sodium). C. Used 1/2 teaspoon Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy seasoning. D. Added 2 ounces canned Jalape?os. The flavor was fantastic (not too hot - just a little kick) but the chili could be thicker. Will try adding some cornmeal to thicken it more next time.,2012-07-05
81494,1179225,3,0,"This was very different from the usual chili I make. It turned out good, just not what I was expecting. I ended up adding a tablespoon more chili powder and only using a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and still found it a little overpowering and I do prefer more tomato in chili. I really liked the idea of adding pureed white beans. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",2013-04-11
81494,2905389,5,1,"This chile is amazing! I was looking for a low fat alternative using ground turkey, and this is the one! I doubled the tomatoes and added a little extra cumin, chile and brown sugar. I also used fresh corn. I smashed the beans in a bowl instead of pureeing, they really add a nice texture to the chile. My husband gave this recipe 5 stars and requested I make it again next week. Even in the heat of summer, this recipe isnt too heavy and is nice paired with a fresh garden salad.",2013-07-17
81494,1800182951,5,1,I used 2 28oz. cans of tomatoes. Added chopped peppers. Added 4 tbsp. butter and increased some spices. I did not puree beans as I forgot. This was an excellent recipe. will make this often.,2013-11-03
81494,1632023,5,1,I substituted great northern beans for cannelini and added a can of red beans for variety.  I use Tony Chachere Cajun seasoning so omitted the hot sauce.   Had about a cup of tomato sauce left in the fridge so threw that in.  Ditto for about 3 tblsps of barbecue sauce.  Used Mexican corn because that was in the freezer.  Omitted the cinnamon but the chili could probably have withstood a pinch of it. This seems to be a recipe you can play with!,2015-10-09
81494,1802987168,2,0,"I made this last night but used chicken instead of turkey. As is, it was too bland for me and I would add 1/4 of the cinnamon that the recipe calls for. Had to double the cayenne and hot sauce and add a teaspoon of salt as well as a packet of Goya ham flavored seasoning. To give it some color since the meat didn&#039;t brown too well I added two teaspoons of tomato paste. Next time I will use half the black beans and add jalape&ntilde;os and green peppers. I love the spicy Mrs. Dash idea too.",2015-11-18
81494,2002323953,5,1,"This was a delicious chili! I love the idea of blending the white beans - it made for a great flavour and creamy texture. I didn't have tomatoes with chilies, so I just put tomatoes and some salsa. I also did not add the sugar - it didn't need it in my opinion. Delish!",2018-11-07
293047,419850,5,1,"This is so good.  I did change it a bit, substituting crawfish tails for the oysters, but it was amazing!

Another thing I used this for was as a toping over fish. Just omitted the cheese and this also was a huge hit with the family!",2009-07-31
293047,674749,5,1,"really good.  I too used crawfish tails, but I think any seafood would be great!",2011-06-21
293047,2001675130,5,1,This came out perfect. Used shrimp crawfish tails and mini scallops. My family loved it and sai tasted just like pappadeaux.,2017-08-16
287766,452355,5,1,"We enjoyed this recipe for dinner last night.  It was very easy to make and required minimal prep, which is always a good thing.  The sauce is very delicious.  Because the recipe did not specify when to add the grapeseed oil, I used it to brown the duck in the skillet.  The only change I made to the recipe was to leave on the duck skin.  We served the duck with pole beans and mashed potatoes.  I would definitely make this again.  Thanks!",2010-09-18

417253,424680,5,1,"Will admit that I don't have a cookie press, but a friend of my was happy to lend me hers (in return for a couple dozen cookies, of course!) & I managed to manipulate my way through this recipe without any major problems & had great fun all along the way! Of course, this chocoholic also loves sugar cookies, so these were a great treat! Not that I'll make them often, but once in a while they will make a nice addition to the finger food counters I fill out (usually) twice a month! And for the holidays, a nice addition to any cookie bag gift! Thanks for sharing a great recipe! [Made & reviewed while in Germany with the 6th Zaar World Tour]",2010-05-25
54350,61660,4,1,I thought this was good.  It was a little too thick for my taste so I would add extra broth next time.  I did pass this along to a vegetarian friend who really liked it using vegetable stock (she still uses dairy).,2003-03-24
54350,30674,1,0,"I found this too thick and it needed more of a ""kick"".  I made it twice and the second time I added more broth to the soup and more spices - it is a decent base recipe but it needs a bit more work.",2003-04-06
54350,87119,5,1,"This was really good soup.  I like soup really thick, which it was, and the green pepper was a nice blend with the mushrooms.  I'll make this in the Winter I know.",2003-05-24

167019,855605,5,1,"This was very very good.  I wasn't sure about baking the pie crust before baking the pie, but I did and when it was time to bake the pie I just put foil over the crust around the edges in case it was going to brown it further (since it was already browned from baking the crust ahead of time).  Also, I made it the night before and heated it up before I served it and it didn't cut well.  Cut when it's cold or else it will come out as piles of pie.  Maybe all pie is like that, I'm not sure.  At any rate, this was a very good pie and I will be making it again.",2008-10-26
58930,4470,5,1,"Very distinctive taste which I find very appealing. One guest did not care for the flavor but then, she rarely likes anything new or slightly different .I used frozen Italian Prune Plums that I had in the freezer. Worked well.  The sauce is just not as chunky as you describe it but has a nice consistency.  I put the leftover sauce in 1/2 cup jars and froze  them.  Nice to hear that it freezes well. I used this sauce as a topping on stuffed Pertobello mushrooms but I can think of a dozen recipes that ir would do well in - Glaze for chicken, Dip for Appies etc etc etc  Thanks Kc I wuill think of you every time I use this tasty sauce.",2003-05-11

58930,223979,5,1,This is a nice sauce.  I used jalapenos from my garden and plums from my tree.  I also used lemons and oranges from my trees.  I love recipes that use stuff that we grow.  Thanks!,2006-07-13

I did have to use a bit more flour than called for in the recipe, possibly an entire cup more, but I think that had more to do with my potatoes than anything.  I did not use my food processor, I just used a hand held mixer and it worked well.  The end result were two beautiful loaves of bread that my family demolished in no time flat.

But I really also tasted the garlic, and that never had that before. I think in some ways, tasting the garlic is very good, simply because if you&#039;re going to make something garlic-y, you might as well go all the way.

209454,117781,5,1,"My husband is in the Navy and we have been stationed in San Diego twice and Rubios fish tacos are some of the things we miss most dearly about the area! I had high hopes for this recipe and was certainly not disappointed!  I admit I did not fry my fish, so I can't vouch for the batter, but I marinated some orange  rough filets, grilled them and served them with the salsa and white sauce and topped with shredded cabbage.  I finished each taco with a slice of ripe avocado and a sprinkling of cilantro.   I used plain greek yogurt for the white sauce and light mayo and found that it was a little thick and didn't have quite the ""tang"" of Rubio's recipe. So, I added some fresh lime juice and it was perfect!  I didn't have quite enough fresh tomatoes for the salsa, so I threw in a can of Rotel, extra garlic, extra cilantro, fresh lime juice and 1 tsp of cumin. I used only one jalepeno, as we don't like it too spicy. It was the best salsa I have ever made and was astonishingly close to the way Rubio's tastes. The corn tortillas are a MUST, do not substitute flour or it won't be a ""real"" fish taco and won't taste the same. If your corn tortillas are on the thin side, do what ubio's does and double them up (stack two together and add fish and condiments on top, then fold) so your taco doesn't get too soggy and fall apart. 
My husband said these were BETTER than Rubio's! I thought they were quite good as well. Thanks for sharing!",2008-05-23

This may be because some brands of garlic powder have salt in them. I used lemon pepper and garlic powder, salt, flour, and beer in the batter. I used cod. There was a lot of trial and error involved because I didn&#039;t know how much salt and spices to add. I also added lime juice, cumin, salt, nutmeg, and sugar to the white sauce. Next time I will not add in sugar or greatly reduce it. I didn&#039;t make the salsa so I can&#039;t say anything about that.",2015-10-23

Next time I'm craving cherry ice cream, I think I may take this base, but just soak the cherries in warm water or a less assertive type of liquor, such as amaretto, and see how that turns out. Thank you for posting this recipe. ",2004-10-27
270158,88378,5,1,"Wowee kazam!  This was absolutely wonderful!  I used enough boneless chicken breasts (cut into small portions and flattened somewhat) to serve 5.  Probably about 1.5 lbs. of boneless chicken breast.  I increased marinating ingredients accordingly, but not the hot sauce.  We had kids to feed, so I kept the hot sauce at 1 T. while increasing (minimally) the oil and honey.  It was nicely spicy but not too much.  The reserved sauce to drizzle over the chicken at the end was great!  This chicken went well with grilled red potatoes saturated in olive oil and fresh herbs, and sides of corn, peas and glazed baby carrots.  Early summer grilling at its best!  This recipe is a winner!",2011-06-06

322276,1256576,5,1,"Bien fait, Granma Hilda! I really like how this recipe uses so many fresh, whole ingredients. It's fairly expensive and time-consuming to make, but the end results are worth it -- delicious!

Alterations: I needed to feed four men, so I used more chicken: to be exact, 4 thighs and 4 drumsticks (bone-in, skin-on). It turned out great! I used extra tomatoes and olives to balance the extra chicken (while keeping the squash at 2 pounds). My supermarket didn't have plum tomatoes, so I bought the closest thing I could find -- small tomatoes on the vine, bigger than grape tomatoes but smaller than romas.

I served this dish with baked potatoes and green beans as sides. (I also cooked a skillet of bacon, which I used to flavor the green beans and make bacon bits for the baked potatoes.) Four hungry guys got fed, and there were even leftovers. It was the best meal I've cooked in a long time.",2010-01-07

Unlike airy, bubbly bakery rolls, these are the way home-made rolls should be...with a bread-ier texture and so inviting for pats of butter or fruity jam or gooey peanut butter.

They don't know up here what great barbecue is (LOL)  but now they do! I had so many people ask  me for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!,2009-07-23
347026,423494,5,1,A nice change from tomato based BBQ.  I love it on pulled pork.,2010-02-22
22821,270514,5,1,AMAZING!!  I just can't stop talking about this tart.  DH called it a cross between white pizza and margarita pizza.  There wasn't a temperature listed so in making this at high altitude I used 375C for 20 minutes and it was perfect!  I added 1/2 tsp salt to the mayo mix and used the crust from Recipe #37455 Boboli Pizza Crust Clone by princess buttercup.  These two recipes should always be made together!  I can't wait to make this again.  I hope everyone will see these two reviews and really try a simple recipe for your busy night dinner.,2007-08-22

Thank you!!",2009-02-25
76296,52282,5,1,"rita, i loved this, just loved the dressing, it's a keeper. i subbed basil for cilantro and used the scallions. i did use the rice vinegar, but i omitted the celery- this was great!",2003-11-22
76296,186487,5,1,"I loved this dressing.  SO delicious.  I was in a hurry and didn't have several ingredients, so I just used the red cabbage, snow peas, and grated carrot.  I probably shouldn't rate this, since I made it so differently, but the dressing is so good I didn't want to pass up the chance.  Thanks for this!",2005-07-15
76296,232667,5,1,"
What a delicious, unique slaw.  The dressing is superb.  I added the extra peanut butter for a thicker dressing as you suggested.  Possibilities are endless, and next time I might add oranges and sprouts!  ",2005-09-04

76296,119422,4,1,"This is pretty good. I didn't have red peppers and I think I missed them. I will try again with the peppers and the extra PB. Also, I will add extra sesame seeds. I do have to say, my 11 yr. old dd, who is very picky, told me that it was very good. Coming from her, that is a compliment!!! Thanks-",2007-06-07
76296,131560,4,1,A very good cabbage salad. I made the dressing according to the recipe except I just added a scoop of peanut butter (probably a little more than a tablespoonful)and I forgot the cilantro in the fridge. I used at least two cups of cabbage and had just enough dressing. If you are increasing the vegetables beyond that I would also increase the amount of dressing.  The recipe went home with two different people so I know it was a success. Thank you very much.,2008-02-04
76296,262423,5,1,"This was really good. I ended up using green onions instead of shallots, and I didn't have any celery. I had to syb the peanut butter for soy nut butter (DS allergies) and it worked great. Thanks for sharing!",2008-05-05
76296,257653,5,1,This is pretty good and healthy to boot!  I added a quarter of a granny smith apple (shredded) and eliminated the snow pea pods (couldn't find them in produce).  I will be making this often this summer!!!  Thank you for the recipe.,2008-07-05
76296,227456,4,1,"I made a this for my lunch for the next two days, but leaving the dressing off until that morning.  I used green beans instead of the snow peas, regular cabbage, didn't have any cilantro, added some carrots and some raisins.  The dressing was very simple, I didn't even blend it, I just minced the garlic and the ginger, tossed it in a jar and shook and it was good to go.  I noticed that there was a kind of ?starchy? feeling to the dressing but that just might have been the pb I used, it had a great flavor though.  Next time I'll be sure to use more red pepper flakes!  It was super simple and tasted great!",2008-09-04
76296,273527,5,1,"YUMMY!! I pref. my dressing thick so I added an unmeasurable amount of peanut butter. I used creamy fat free Peter Pan. (I wonder how regular CHUNKY Skippy would taste-- MMMM...)  I did use rice vinegar (Kame brand) but think I might cut a bit back next time- end product was a wee bit acidic. Rita, thank you for posting a keeper!!",2008-12-28
76296,921940,4,1,"I made a lot of substitutions/exclusions based on what was in our cupboards, but this was still a really good salad.

76296,39394,2,0,Let's start with the good - visually a beautiful salad.  Followed the directions exactly as written and didn't like it at all.  The two people I shared it with did not like it either.  Flavors were just off.,2009-03-12
76296,953275,4,1,"I liked this very much - the dressing flavour combo is a favourite of mine.  I felt the amount of oil was pretty high, which is about the only thing I would change.  And well, I did....I cut back on the oil and the vinegar by about 1/3 - and that was fine because I was missing some of the veg this salad called for anyway.  This is one of the best ways to enjoy raw cabbage - thanks Rita!",2010-07-24
76296,2288968,4,1,At first I thought this was a little off but the more I ate the better it was.  I think if you give it some time for the flavors to blend it gets better.  My husband loved it and he doesn't even like red cabbage so that says a lot.  I do think if I made it again I might play around and make some adaptations.  As it was I didn't have any sesame oil so I used tahini instead.  I also used a gypsy pepper instead of red pepper.,2012-06-24
76296,57222,4,1,So good and so pretty! I cut down on the oil and vinegar just a notch and added a bit more sugar (had one of those dull-tasting red cabbages so I felt it needed balancing) - will make again! Thank you Rita!,2012-06-29
291808,305531,5,1,Yum! I recently ate at Carrabba's for the first time and loved this dish there. This tastes just like it. I think that next time I will reduce the sauce a little bit more so that it is a little thicker. Thanks hollyberry for a great meal. Made for Bargain Basement Tag.,2010-03-28
291808,1831660,5,1,"This recipe is very similar to Carrabba's. I enjoyed making it and it tasted amazing!!!  The only thing I would add less of, would be the sun dried tomatoes (partly because I am not a big fan of them).",2011-02-20
291808,2001154449,5,1,Amazing!!!! I always get Chicken Bryan at Carabbas and this recipe is spot on! It came out perfectly. Even hubby who sticks with Chicken Parm thought it was delicious! Thank you!,2016-09-04

112339,176615,5,1,"These are SO GOOD! My three boys (8,5,and 3) inhlaed these, eating 10 rolls between them before 10 am! I used the bread machine for kneading the dough, using zest from an entire organic orange. Formed the rolls and then refrigerated overnight. Let rise in the morning (turn the oven on, let it warm up just a bit, then turn off and leave the pan in the oven until rolls are doubled in size; remove rolls from oven, preheat, then bake). Mine were ready after baking time of 17 minutes so watch carefully. I doubled the icing, adding just a bit of orange extract instead of zest out of pure laziness. Icing as is would be enough, especially if served for lunch next to chicken salad (yum), but I'd use about 1.5x the amount for breakfast. Pilsbury doesn't hold a candle to these! Thanks for sharing the recipe!",2007-01-29
112339,119466,5,1,"Delicious! I used real butter (rather than margarine), let the KitchenAid handle the kneading, and formed the rolls the night before, refrigerating until morning. I increased the icing by 50% and included the optional orange zest. Great recipe--thanks for posting!",2007-02-09
112339,331582,4,1,"Yummy!  These were fabulous!  I made the dough in my bread machine and it worked out great.  I did add 1tsp. cinnamon to the dough mixture, and 1/4c. cream cheese to the icing.  My oven may be a little off, but I cooked them for 20 min and that worked out fine.  Oh, and it made 12 med. sixed rolls for me.",2007-04-21
112339,91392,4,1,"Similar to Pillsbury's.  Next time I will try putting the dough up next to each other so they are softer when cooked.  Not touching, I found them to be too firm.  Great taste though.",2007-07-22
112339,537188,4,1,"Lovely! I think next time I won't bother cutting the roll up, but I'll just put it into a bread pan as I found that the crust was a bit too hard...It's a really good recipe though!",2007-12-28

112339,685988,5,1,"So delicious! My family loves the Pillsbury Orange Rolls, but I'm hesitant to buy them with all the preservatives in there. I gave these a shot for Easter brunch and they were a huge hit. I used organic butter, OJ, and flour. Still fattening, but without all the chemicals and additives. Husband's response, ""You MADE these??""  He ate 3 at once. I was a tad lazy and didn't bother with the orange zest and the orange flavor was still there from the juice but was not overwhelming and was good for my picky eaters. I also added about 4oz. of cream cheese for the icing which really topped it off. He has already asked me to make them again and they were actually very easy to make too. I let my bread machine do the work and the dough was perfect. Made the brunch extra special - thank you!!!",2008-04-09

I've eagerly been searching the web for a recipe that was comparable.  These surpass them by a mile!!!  I made them for Easter morning, but my family requested that I make the regularly.  I definitely will!  I did add 1 T butter to the icing; the butter made it just a tad creamier. Oh, and these made quite a few rolls - we had more than enough left over for the next morning.",2010-04-07

If you're looking for an awesome recipe, try this one!!<br/><br/>Here's a tip:  The easiest way I have found to cut the rolls is to use a piece of dental floss (no, really!!).  Slide the floss under the roll to where you want to cut it, pull the ends over the top, cross them and pull.  Voila!  Nice clean cuts without smashing the roll with a knife.",2012-01-01

55297,88509,5,1,"Just finished eating this pasta dish for dinner. Wow! As Derf mentioned in the last review (Fresh Taste) I think is the keynote here. Chicken added, would be a nice addition. Garlic and lemon really are great together, the lemon zest adds just the right amount of zing. This recipe is so simple that I pretty much just winged it, and did not follow the exact measurements but it still turned out great. A great combo with this dish is a fresh salad with ginger salad dressing which you can find the recipe for else where on this site. Delicious!!!",2003-06-03

2791,799439,5,1,"After finding about 3 different popular recipes for Outback's delicious Creamy Onion Soup (a.k.a. Walkabout Onion Soup), I decided to go with this one.  Am I'm glad I did!  

I made this for my wife and me, and we both loved it.  Taste-wise, it is pretty much identical, best I could tell (and I've eaten this soup at Outback quite a bit).  Texture-wise, it was slightly thinner, and slightly greasier -- but not enough to make a difference.  I was more concerned with taste than texture, and in that regard, it exceeded expectations.

Another note, I added a bit of sage, per comments from another review of another recipe (by an ex-Outback employee).  I think this made a difference, and possibly made it more like the original.  I also added a third oz. of Velveeta.  Lastly, while the ingredients call for 2 tbsp. of butter, the instructions call for 3 -- I went with 3, which may have been why it was a tad greasier.

Thanks, Molly, for the great recipe.  I'll definitely be making this again, and for a bigger party!",2008-03-23
2791,187373,5,1,"Great soup! Don't think I've ever had the Outback version, but we enjoyed this. I had to sub regular cheese for Velveeta since what we had in the fridge was hard and dry! But delicious nonetheless! I also left out all the salt since I thought it would be too much with the bouillon cubes. (I subbed cubes with water for the broth.) Also used skim milk since that's all we keep around here! Edited to add: Wow, guess I underestimated how much DH loved this soup...he just finished the leftovers and wanted me to make it again yesterday!",2008-05-11
2791,852908,5,1,"The first time I made this is was WAYYY too salty, and I didn't add the salt due to previous reviews stating it was too salty.  This recipe is delicious and so close to outbacks besides the fact that outbacks was much creamier than this.  I used low sodium chicken broth(safeway brand's has less sodium than Swanson's low sodium), and a lower sodium chicken boullion that came in a packet..I can't remember what it's called it has the word herbal in it.  That didn't make a too delicious flavor though so I added one chicken boullion cube without any water to match it.   I have made this recipe twice in the last week, it is delicious!  Everyone loves it and can't have just one bowl.  For more than 3 full bowls, I recommend doubling the recipe.",2008-06-03

I'm not a big onion fan, but I do appreciate the flavor they can give a dish. I chopped up only about a 1/4-1/2 a cup of onion and that was muuuch better. Also, I boiled some bite sized pieces of potato and threw those in too because the Outback in my area has potatoes in there. <br/><br/>Overall, the recipe was great and I will definitely be using it for years :)",2011-02-06

2791,2228618,5,1,"We order this every time we go to Outback if it's available. Since we have to drive at least 1 1/2 hours to the nearest Outback we don't get there too often so I was very happy to find this recipe. I recently fixed it for my wife's family and we all agree that it tastes exactly like the original. The only thing I did different was to let it cook at least an hour longer on low heat. Also, I don't really think it's possible to use too many onions since they cook into the soup. I use about 4-5 medium sized onions for this recipe. The sad thing is it's always gone by the end of the day.",2012-04-03
2791,2286169,5,1,"I have not had the Walkabout soup in years so I can't really state how close it is.  However, as a creamy onion soup, it is very good.<br/><br/>I followed the directions with three minor changes.  Normally I advocate following the recipe exactly as it is or else I don't review it but these were small changes.  I omitted the first 1/4 teaspoon of salt, used Knorr reduced stock (1 tub) in place of the bouillon and used Velveeta Queso Blanco rather than regular.  Those substitutions were due to what I had on hand.<br/><br/>The directions were very clear and I ended up with a creamy, oniony soup that was delicious just as it was and I'm sure I will make it again.  <br/><br/>If I were to serve it as a main dish for more than just myself, I would serve it with bowls of croutons, cooked potato cubes, diced ham, cooked corn, shredded cheese, etc...  so that people could dress it up themselves.  But as a starter, it would be great as it is.",2012-06-06

2791,1365025,4,1,I don&#039;t know what I did wrong but my soup didn&#039;t turn out looking very good.The milk in the white sauce curdled after putting on warm for 30 minutes. The flour for the white sauce got lumpy but the taste was really good. I refuse to let this great tasting soup defeat me so I made it again the next night and I think I conquered it.  LOL! This time I used cornstarch in the white sauce like I usually do when I make a white sauce. Yea no lumps!  Great tasting soup. Maybe next time I will add a little white cooking wine to the soup as it cooks.Thanks Molly for posting. Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup,2013-07-03

Great recipe, and i never, ever made soup from scratch before.  However, feel I must have done something wrong - maybe too much milk, because I had to add more pepper and cheese to boost flavor.  Didn&#039;t use the bouillon cubes, and maybe that&#039;s it.  Next time, I will try to prepare exactly to directions.  Even still, it&#039;s a flavorful soup that&#039;s very satisfying.

You do NOT need to do anything special with the &quot;white sauce&quot; - I know the other recipes you find on YouTube go into some detail about thickening the white sauce in another pot, but you DON&quot;T need to. I just put all the white sauce ingredients in a blender (flour, butter, whole milk) and blend until it is totally incorporated and actually foamy. This method completely eliminates the &quot;chunky&quot; uneven mix you get if the white sauce doesn't like the temperature of the chicken broth.

Was short on a couple of spices but improvised and it turned out wonderful. Just a tip to keep in mind though: let fish drain on paper towels before cooking so that water won't interfere with the cooking process. Mine was still delicious but I believe this is supposed to be a drier type of coating. Every few bites you'll taste the oregano and OMG that makes it for me.

Used half and half instead of cream, because that's what I had. I thought the sauce was excellent as written, but did add an additional 2 tbsp half and half to cut the dijon a bit, as dh is not quite the dijon fiend I am.

I want to add that I think next time I will bake the filets while I make the sauce, to save on time and also because the flipping and in-and-out of the pan action took its toll on my tilapia and it was in pieces by the time the dish was done.",2008-05-05

I just felt it could do with something else, so I added a teaspoon of chicken stock powder and added some light cream to give the extra liquid needed with the added stock. My family did not know I had done this and raved and said it was delicious. So I am not sure what they would have said without this, for them it may have still got the same rave reviews. I served this over gnocchi (for quickness) and kept the chicken as whole breasts and sliced and served over the top.

305796,463858,4,1,"This is a very tasty dish.  The flavor of the dill and potatotes with the garlic and sour cream were excellent.
There were a couple of things I might do differently when I make it next, however.  First, I would not cook the potatoes until tender.  They cook more when added in with the chicken, so I would cook them just shy of done.  I would also turn the heat down and add the sour cream to the herbs prior to adding the potatoes and chicken.  Thanks for posting.  Made and reviewed for ZWT4.",2008-06-11
305796,11297,5,1,This was so easy to make especially using some already cooked chicken that I had on hand.  I also used dried dill as I couldn't get any fresh. Think it was about 1Tbsp or a bit more.  I too added some cream to thin out the sauce a little.  The only other change I made was to add some diced red pepper for colour.

I also used 1/2 c of homemade chicken stock in with the sour cream 'cos it was starting to go a bit 'gloppy', and it helped the sauce go further.  Thankyou for this little gem.

305796,197023,5,1,"Delicious easy to make recipe; scrumptious sauce.  The fresh dill was a brilliant ingredient here, and well worth hunting out if you are making this recipe. Guided by other reviewers' mention of adding extra liquid, I saw the opportunity to add about 1/2 cup of wine in step 8.  I also used Greek yoghurt instead of the sour cream (something which I standardly use in recipes calling for cream).  I used skinless chicken breasts, halved.  In step 5, I also added about a cup of sliced mushrooms; for me, another favourite ingredient.  Next time, I'll probably add another potato as the potato pieces tasted delicious with the herby sauce and chicken.  After thoroughly enjoying this dish, we had still had enough to freeze - always satisfying!  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe, Sydney Mike.",2008-07-29
305796,470351,4,1,This was a tasty dish!  I found it slightly lacking in seasoning so I added Garli Garni (a form of garlic powder that I love!) and even added some crushed red peppers.  My husband thought it rated a 3.5...I thought a 4 so 4 it is!  I increased the garlic to 6 cloves and used closer to a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I used the correct amount of scallions and fresh dill.

305796,428885,4,1,"Really nice dish, an ease to prepare, and has so many possibilities as noted by previous reviewers. The base recipe is great, although I did reduce the dill (fresh used here to 1/4 cup). A very aromatic dish, one that begs you to scoop up the sour/cream type gravy with a slice of bread. I added a mixture of white wine/stock here, mushrooms and served over some nice whole grain rice. Thank you for a wonderful treat, Syd! Made for *Everyday is a Holiday* Dec 2008",2008-12-14
305796,1334396,4,1,"Awesome dish! I added some chopped mushrooms as someone had done previously, so extra liquid was provided by these. Combined with the juices from the browned chicken, I had to add a little flour after simmering for a while to thicken it up. I also used whole baby red skinned potatoes, and chopped boneless skinless chicken breasts. I didn't have quite enough garlic, and added too much dill (I think), so I mucked it up a bit. I am now a fan of fresh dill! I don't think dried would have cut it. Other than the silly BF pawning potatoes off on me and telling me he doesn't like boiled potatoes, we loved it! Next time I will use the proper amounts of garlic and dill and it should be even more awesome. I may also try it sans potatoes and over brown rice, for my picky potato eating irishman. I served this alongside some good 'ol Ontario corn. Leftovers were my absolutely delish lunch the following day. Thank you!",2009-09-27

315013,213139,3,0,Made for Newest Zaar Tag 2008 (June).  This was okay - but not exactly a top ten recipe.  We thought the sage was a little overpowering.  I think this would be better with either thyme or rosemary.  Will try it again using one of those herbs.  Other than the taste of the sage the chicken was good and it was very easy to make.,2008-08-24
315013,29754,5,1,"YUM!! I made this last night using about 4 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs and it turned out much better than expected.  I didn't use sage since it isn't a favorite here but I didn't replace it with another herb either except some dried parsley.  I didn't have a bell pepper and wasn't in the mood for canned chilies that would have made it taste like a Mexican dish.  I cooked up about 3/4 package of maple smoked bacon (all I had) and dredged the thighs in seasoned flour before browning them. I used a good splash of cooking Marsala since I didn't have any white wine, and I think any kind of wine or spirit, even beer, would work, or just leave it out.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It took an entire cardboard container (32 oz.) of ""natural"" chicken broth.  It turned out great!  Real nice and smoky with the dark paprika! I probably used 3 tablespoons or more of it because I really wanted to be able to taste it.  I had printed the recipe out and will tape it inside my cabinet so I can find it again.  It was very fast and easy!  The only thing I will do differently next time is to squeeze some lemon juice into it.  When I later fixed myself a second plate of chicken and rice, I sprinkled some True Lemon crystallized lemon over it (didn't have a fresh lemon) before I warmed it.  I really think it needed that little extra bite of citrus flavor so I wrote that on my printout for next time.  I think a tablespoon of orange juice concentrate stirred into the broth before cooking would be good, too.  Thanks for giving me something new to do with chicken!  I will definitely make this again!

201338,2000726552,4,1,"Well. They taste really good. But they spread out while baking, and pretty much looked like a pan of brownies. They stuck to the pan and to each other so they&#039;re mostly just chunks I had to cut into the shape of cookies.... And by that I mean squares. And by squares I mean not any identifiable shape. I would make again, but would add more flour next time. But they do taste great.",2015-12-03

11763,160977,4,1,"Very easy to make and the result is a dense, moist cake. Took the suggestion of previous reviewers and added more lemon to the cake. Actually I added about one tablespoon of lemon zest. Made the glaze but did not pour it over the cake at once. Instead I drizzled a little of the glaze on every slice of the cake whenever we ate it. Yummy! In between I kept the glaze in the fridge.(it did not have to stay in the fridge for too long as the cake was gone within a couple of days)
Thanks for posting.",2007-01-28
11763,278546,5,1,"I've just finished baking this cake for the first time, it turned out wonderful! I used self-raising flour instead (did away with the baking powder), went slightly less on sugar, and doubled the lemon juice to more than 2 tablespoons. I also added in plenty of lemon rinds - almost three lemons' worth of rinds - which really enhanced the flavor with a very fresh and citrusy fragrance. I wouldn't hesitate to add even more next time! I also added a tinge of almond essence (~1/2 teaspn) for a nice twist and it complimented the flavor well. The end result already tastes so delicious and lemony that I find it unnecessary to have additional glaze - a nice way to cut back on mmmore sugar :).  This recipe is a must-keeper.",2007-04-21

11763,88910,4,1,"This was a dense, soft and moist cake even though I made a vegan version of, using soymilk. I omitted the salt, as I usually do and used a mixture of white, whole-wheat and buckwheat flours and baked it in my kugelhopf tin since the bundt cake in the photograph looks so tempting. Additionally I increased the quantity of baking powder to 1-1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. of baking soda. Since I did want the extra sugar of a glaze and because I desired an ultra lemon flavour, I added the zest and juice of lemons. Incidently, I did not replace the eggs except by increasing the baking agents. The lemon made up for the liquid content of the eggs as well as presumably reacting with the baking powder and soda to produce well-risen cake. I have not had success with lemon-cake for a while but this certainly compensated for the past failures. Thank you. I will use the recipe again.",2007-10-01

I followed the recipe exactly except I was a little short on lemon so I just grated half of a lemon's worth of zest and put that in the batter instead of the lemon juice.

11763,1061845,5,1,"This recipe was absolutely delicious! I am not a fan of lemon, so instead I substituted lemon juice for 1/2 - 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 - 3/4  tsp. of cinnamon. I started to put the batter in a mini cupcake pan (12) and cooked that, then decided that it would take too long and poured the rest into a regular cake pan (which is still cooking!). I'm so glad that I made the mini cupcakes because they are holding me over till the cake is done! The glaze I am using came from a separate recipe I found in a magazine. 1 Tbs. Butter, 1/2 C powdered sugar, and 2 - 3 Tbs. milk. Whisk the butter and gradually add in the sugar and milk to get a nice thick, creamy consistency, drizzle over and allow to set. (For this cake recipe, the icing recipe would have to be doubled or tripled.) Fantastic, easy cake...will be making this again and again when I'm having one of my ""sweet"" cravings!",2008-12-07

This one really deserves more than 5 stars.  Was simple and quick to make as written.  My adult daughter said this one is a definite keeper.  The only thing  I did differently was to make it in a bundt pan and it turned out wonderfully.  Yummmm.  I will  make this as our dessert choice for Easter.",2009-04-03
11763,41984,5,1,This was very easy to put together.  I used the batter in a lamb cake mold (it fit perfectly) and baked it for the specified time.  The cake turned out perfectly.  I didn't add the lemon and sugar mixture on the cake since I was going to frost the lamb and add coconut but I'm sure that the mixture would have been a nice addition.  The lemon flavoring was very delicate (to me) and a very nice twist on traditional pound cake.  Thank you very much for posting this recipe.  I'm sure that this won't be the last time I make this cake!,2009-04-12

Update: Tastes even more good the next day. The best ever.",2010-04-15
11763,734891,5,1,I made this all last summer and just made it again tonight for the first time this year. I made minor changes. I double this (except for the glaze) and I add the zest of 2 whole med. lemons in the batter. Then I bake it at 350 for about 105min in a large heavy dark metal Noritake fancy loaf pan. (your oven may vary-toothpick test in the center still applies). The edges get deep brown but not burnt and it tastes great. I glaze w/ a single batch of glaze rather than double. I cut my loaf in slices in the pan but it doesn't stick.(I spray my pan well with crisco oil spray before filling). This is the perfect summer cake served alone or with fresh berries.,2009-05-23

I can't wait to make it again...just as soon as I wash the pan I baked it in!",2009-05-30

I was looking for an easy recipe for a Lemon-Scented Mascarpone Trifle I wanted to make, and didn't want to use store-bought pound cake. This was the quick-n-easy recipe! I upped the lemon juice to 2 tablespoons and used 1/4 tsp. lemon oil for extra citrus! I followed the directions, just varying by creaming room temperature (not melted) butter and the sugar. Then adding the room temperature eggs one at a time...mixing until they were incorporated. Then I combined the flour, salt and baking powder and slowly added it alternately with the 1/2 cup milk, beginning and ending with the flour and mixing only until things were incorporated.

11763,113509,5,1,"This was DELICIOUS. I cut the recipe in half and made it in a muffin pan, since I don't have a mini-loaf pan.

So after it baked with no milk, I just doubled the lemon juice, sugar on poked several holes for the topping to soak in good. It was great!!!. Next time I made it correctly, with milk.

I did add some lemon zest from one lemon but next time I won't be so bashful. I would add the zest from 2-3 lemons for sure! Also, if you like lemon as my family does add more lemon juice to the cake. I used 1/4 cup of milk and just over 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Next time I may use only 1-2 tbsp of milk and at least 1/2 cup of lemon juice. Btw I did have to bake mine about 1 hr 20 min, but the texture was great! It was moist and light.

11763,620763,5,1,Delicious! I added zest of one lemon and a bit of lemon extract. This cake is lighter and not as dense as a traditional pound cake. We all enjoyed it.,2012-03-31
11763,132010,5,1,"I tried it and this was great!!  It was like having pound cake without the extra butter!!  I tasted like a ""light"" pound cake to me.  I doubled the lemon based on the advice of other reviewers.  The glaze really brings it all together!  I used my 8 count mini loaf pan. Thanks for posting!",2012-03-31
11763,298200,3,0,I made this cake this afternoon and was very disappointed in the way it came out.   I would not call it a poundcake at all.  It was spongy and very sugary and i didnt make the drizzle.  I will look for another recipe and not forward this to anyone....sorry  Would not make this again....also batter was very thin.,2012-04-01
11763,928301,3,0,"what I loved about it was that it was easy...one bowl & no buttermilk.  I used it to get to another product I'd seen on food.com without all the steps.  In essence, I added two cups of frozen triple berry blend. I put a tablespoon of flour and a little sugar in with the berries & mixed them prior to adding in.  And I added them right before stirring in the milk.  That made the mixture purple, but the cake came out a good color.  <br/><br/>I really didn't like the glaze step because it had me fearful of sogginess--which my husband complained of.  He also complained of too much lemon flavor.  I thought the opposite--not enough, but he got the edge piece so that's probably why.  Anyway, due to those complaints, I'll follow other reviewer's suggestions and either put more lemon juice into the cake--trading 1/4 cup of milk out for 1/4 cup of it then not add the glaze. Or I'll use POWDERED sugar, rather than normal sugar, in the glaze to thicken it.",2012-07-16

I&#039;m lazy so I used the lemon that comes in the squeeze bottles and doubled it. I substituted Splenda for the sugar and it turned out yummy. I skipped the drizzle and made a glaze out of sugar free lemon pudding mix, powdered sugar and a little milk.

11763,1940575,5,1,"Super lemony!  I kicked up the flavor even more by adding lemon zest to the batter and syrup, and then really sent it over the top by finishing it off with a lemon glaze (about 1 cup powdered sugar mixed with a couple tablespoons fresh lemon juice and lemon zest).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This recipe works equally well with lime.  Just substitute equal parts lime for lemon.  And if you add the zest, the finished product comes out a beautiful pastel green color.  Enjoy.",2013-11-27

This cake is SO GOOD but the lemon glaze is, in fact, a little too tart (and I LOVE tart lemony desserts - I have a  pinterest board to prove it: pinterest.com/deluxerx/the-lemon-merchant/) &lt;br/&gt;I offer this glaze as an alternative | Lemon Glaze: 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice. 1/4 cup sugar. 1/8 cup water. To make the glaze: Mix all ingredients in a small saucepan and stir. Cook over low heat without stirring till the sugar dissolves. Turn heat up to medium and cook mixture until it JUST starts to becomes syrupy. DON&#039;T overcook or the syrup will start to turn brown. Use a round chopstick to poke holes in cake and pour glaze over cake.  Oh yeah, I also added the zest of 1 lemon and 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the batter. Amazingly delicious and easy recipe.",2014-08-14

I didn&#039;t have to worry about alternating the dry ingredients with the wet or anything else too complicated. I did let my eggs come to room temperature and floured as well as greased my pan and used confectioner sugar and fresh lemon juice for the glaze. Soooo good!

The lemon juice and sugar mixture that goes on after baking gives this a wonderfully tart flavor. I also added the grated zest of one whole lemon to the batter. That made it even more lemony! I will definitely make this again. Note, this really doesn&#039;t have the dense heavy texture of pound cake. It&#039;s still good though. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",2015-03-03

I've never made a pudding cake before, although I've seen them, so I don't know how pudding-like the sauce should be.  Mine was pretty liquid, but thickened, not set like a pudding.  That did not detract from taste or appearance.",2004-05-01

Basically the soup itself was kind of boring with just a subtle hint of something interesting in the background, unfortunately it was only interesting until everyone decided they really didn't care for whatever it was. I think it was the combination of mint and cilantro: exotic enough to catch evryone's attention, but ultimately not a flavor combination anyone here enjoyed. The soy-ginger sauce was pretty good. DH thought it helped the soup quite a bit when you just mixed a little of the sauce into it, but nobody really liked it enough to just eat it plain over the extra rice noodles either. Sorry. Just turned out to be very much not our thing.",2006-07-03

375718,222478,5,1,Very nice! I marinated overnight using a good Shiraz and made the butter mix at the same stage. The marinade was great and the butter had a nice tang with just a hint of extra saltiness from the capers that was wonderful not only over the steak but also some corn and potatoes that I served with it.,2010-08-22

Anyway these were very good, but as much as I hate to say this - they would have been better without the chocolate chips. I think the cinnamon in the recipe makes the chocolate taste odd. I used really fresh/good quality cinnamon though so maybe that was the problem (too strong of a flavor). Either way they were very good and I will make again either ommiting the chips or the cinnamon.",2007-11-03

I rinsed my rice first, because I always do, and it kind of sizzled when it hit the pan, but it didn't seem to burn. When about half the liquid was absorbed, I went to turn down the heat, and accidentally turned it UP. I noticed after a couple minutes, but I think it caused some of the liquid to evaporate, and I had to add a bit more. Very buttery and flavorful, next time I'll add either some chopped mushrooms or broccoli florets. Also, I may try using brown rice.",2004-06-25

I did have to make this a few times, though, to see what it was that I was doing wrong. It was either I didn't have enough liquid and it would dry out half cooked or I would add more liquid and it took, like, more than a half an hour to finish cooking the rice. Like I said, it had been a few years. The thing I had forgotten was that once you bring to a boil and lower to simmer, it needs to be covered.

24476,497288,5,1,"Better than the original!! I followed the recipe as directed except for adding some onion while the rice was browning.  Best of all was that my toddler LOVED it and like another reader said- you know what's in it.  I've made it twice already in one week.

I'm so glad I found this recipe because it's easy to substitute gluten-free noodles for the regular spaghetti noodles and use gluten-free broth and it's still easy to make and tastes great. Many thanks.,2008-06-16
24476,777092,4,1,This was really good!  I made it in the rice cooker by browning the vermacilli on the stove first.  I do think that it could actualy use a little more liquid.  It was a twinge dry... not a lot.  I am also a salt freak.  I love it!  It needed to be salted afterwards.  Thanks for the recipe.

Someone suggested toasting slivered almonds with the pasta, and you could also toast pine nuts for a more Middle Eastern flavor.  I made it up as directed, except I used 2 cans of chicken broth and salt and pepper.  While this was cooking, I heated oil in another frying pan and added 1/2 of a leftover onion and when the diced onion was almost tender, added some garlic.  I then added some leftover hamburger and when that was almost cooked, added some leftover tomato paste from the freezer.  I added salt, pepper and Worstershire sauce.  The last two minutes of cooking I stirred in some frozen peas.  When the rice was done, I stirred in the hamburger mixture and sprinkled the top with leftover Parmesan cheese.  It was very good and economical.",2008-08-17

24476,262272,5,1,This is one of the most used recipes that I've found on this site.  I love it!   I've never bought the box mix because I can't handle the salt but loved it as a kid.  I break up a box of angel hair or thin spaghetti and keep it in the pantry.  I've also used O and star shaped pasta but cut it back to 1/4 cup.  I've only made a chicken version of this.  Just before I add the broth I put a good shake of Mrs. Dash Original or Onion and Herb.  Thanks for a great recipe that I've used over and over again.,2008-11-10

I added seasonings in addition to the chicken broth. Also, I had to add a lot more broth than the recipe lists.

24476,226372,4,1,Fun and easy to prepare.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added some finely chopped onion and turmeric. This was a nice change from boring old white rice.  I'm sure that this would be a kid pleaser.....,2009-01-17

I cannot get it to come out the same when I double the recipe--odd,  but I've tried it at least twice and it isn't the same. Oh well, I just make it as the recipe states instead of doubling it.  A big hit at our house!",2009-01-19

24476,136997,5,1,"Simple, easy and very tasty. I used vegetable broth, as my son is a vegetarian, but would be equally as good made with any other flavoured broth. I added some onion and carrot to the mix and finished with some chopped parsley. I sauteed the rice/pasta in a combination butter/oil, added the stock, brought to a boil and finished in the oven. I generally have more luck with the rice not sticking in the pot that way. Perfect. :)",2009-07-20

Very creamy mixture.

So you know it freezes well.
The leftovers have been in the freezer since July 5th.

I will be making more of this again and freezing the left overs.

Delicious! I used Sysco Chicken base with water to make the broth. I followed the directions and found I needed 1/4 more cup of water for the rice to be cooked. Added the water, stirred until absorbed and it was perfect. I used Calrose Rice.
Either the rice or the altitude might have affected the outcome.
I will continue to use. Thanks.",2010-01-22

For the pasta, vermicelli was used. I did have to simmer for about 35  minutes to get the rice completely done. And I added a bit of powdered chicken bouillon to get the flavor that I was used to in the boxed mix.

My interpretation used orzo pasta and the last of my basmati and the last of my wild rice. I also added onions, garlic, mushrooms, toasted almonds and some fresh herbs. Rice-A-What? As somebody trying to watch our sodium intake this is PERFECT. Much better than the box because I know what is in there.

I replaced the broken pasta with orzo because I already had it. I used 2 cups of water and a tablespoon of Better than Bouillon Chicken flavor, plus I added 2 or 3 dried shitake mushrooms (broken up) and some garlic powder and onion powder. Oh and a little dried parsley. I browned the pasta and rice together like the original, and cooked it for 20 minutes after adding the liquid.

Next time I make it, I will break the spaghetti into smaller pieces, just to better mimic the original, not that it will make any difference in taste or anything. I attempted to make only half of this recipe and, as expected, ran into some issues with getting the rice and pasta done before the liquid evaporated. So, I just added more liquid a little bit at a time as the rice cooked. This seemed to work pretty well; but I managed to lose some of the chicken flavor in the process. I am very glad to be able to make this dish so much cheaper than buying it and am excited at the possibilities of what could be done with it. Thank you! UPDATE: I&#039;ve made this recipe several times since my first review. (These days, I usually season it with recipe #105993.) As much as I love the recipe, I kind of dread breaking up the spaghetti noodles. Since I prefer to break them almost as small as the rice, this can be a tedious process.

Found out rice-a-roni (all of their products) is GMO now.  This is absolutely fabulous! The entire family loves this cause it is what rice-a-roni used to be.

In fact, I go to food.com every time I want to find a recipe I can make at home using natural ingredients. This is the only rice a roni recipe I use because it is so easy and the taste is fabulous!  So versatile, too, by subbing the stock and adding your favorite spices.  I use  Gamesa Fideo 100% semilina pasta because it is already broken into small pieces just like in rice a roni but use angel hair pasta when I run out.

I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe. :)",2015-08-17

24476,447199,5,1,"Totally delicious and great if you're trying to cut down on processed foods full of preservatives. This has a richer flavor than the box, too. Here's a few tips that are important: Brown BOTH the pasta and the rice, to give it a nutty flavor. And as with any rice dish, you should bring it to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer until the liquid disappears. Remove from the heat, fluff with a fork, and add any fresh herbs or aromatics you like (try lemon zest! and green onions!) and then let it rest for 5 minutes. Perfection!",2017-12-29

I couldn't shred with forks as directed but before adding sauce I removed from pot and cubed on cutting board. Returned to pot then finished cooking. There was LOTS of sauce so we served open faced on toasted buns. It was a big hit! For PAC. 11-2-07 Made this again and cooked one extra hour.  This enabled me to shred the meat with the forks and it made the sauce a better consistency.",2007-11-02
209937,528468,4,1,"I did have to cook this an hour longer to be able to shred it. This had more tang then I was interested in so I added some bacon, a little bit of bacon grease, hickory barbecue sauce and a little liquid smoke. Otherwise, this was a great recipe!!!",2008-04-04
209937,285039,5,1,"I prepared this earlier in the week using a 3 pound arm roast, and reducing the sauce ingredients in 1/2.  I added 1 cup of water for the first simmer stage, and then let it boil down while I pulled the beef apart.  Because of the size of the roast, I did not have to cook this extra.  At the end of the process, I let it cool a bit on the stovetop and then stored it overnight in the refrigerator.  The next evening I heated it up for dinner and it was fantastic!

I found that the recipe as written was excellent, although I used one more link of sausage than called for and whole wheat penne pasta.  Also I used sundried tomatoes that were just in a pouch and not in oil and they worked great and reconstituted during the cooking process. Also I added red pepper flakes for some heat.

175849,317560,5,1,Wow! I thought this was a great recipe. I use a little extra milk and chicken broth to be sure I had plenty of sauce. I was surprised at how flavorful it was. Left overs were pretty good the next day too. Thanks!,2007-11-30
175849,294215,4,1,"This was pretty good.  My husband had seconds so that's always the sign of something he really likes.  I found it a little salty but I used better then bullion and I probably could have kept it to one cup and then a cup of water.  I think next time I will reduce the amount of chicken broth and up the milk a little bit.  I used dried sundried tomato as well, but I wish I would have softened them first as well because although they softened up the flavour could have been alot stronger.  so my husband gave this 5 but I think it needs a couple of tweaks to be a 5 star.

I adjusted this a little bit, as our family loves our veggies.  while adding the pasta, broth and milk, I added some 1 orange & 1 green pepper and a couple handfuls of sliced mushrooms.  It turned out very hearty, and very yummy with plenty of leftovers for lunches tomorrow (for the three of us).

Thanks!",2010-05-17

175849,742029,5,1,This was rich and creamy yet so easy! We used hot Italian pork sausage and drained the fat before adding the garlic. The only other sub we made was using kale instead of spinach. We are definitely adding this to our regular line up and can't wait to try it with regular Italian sausage too. Thanks for sharing! *****Update - made it again with spinach and a 50/50 blend of hot and regular Italian sausage....still delish!,2013-03-04

Like others I discovered once I'd started making it that I didn't have enough maple syrup and decided to substitute agave syrup to make up the difference.  I also used unbleached flour as it's what was on hand.  I wouldn't say they were fudgy, but the consistency was good and the flavor was really nice.  One of the nicest aspects though was being able to allow my three yr. old to lick the spoon since there was no raw egg in the batter.

I also added one egg and found the texture to be very nice that way. Used a mix of honey and agave and it was way too sweet to my taste. Made it impossible to taste the carob or vanilla flavors.

I have made the first batch and have left a half to prove in the fridge for until the weekend to see what difference there is in taste (spices infuse the dough over time). Ended up adding extra 200 g of flour at the end of kneading, also substituted molasses for black treacle, worked out wonderfully! Golden syrup would probably work just as well for more mellow and lighter in color dough. I used double amount of ginger, mixed peppercorns and cinnamon and some ground cardamom from whole pods. Mulled wine spice mix is perfect for this and you can also use clementine zest for the oomph :) Some of the gingerbreads are stripy because of me using silicone baster on them to glaze with egg. Cookies turn out crisp and you can vary the thickness to your liking. I went from very thin to very thick.

Even still, this was amazing.  I had fears that the pepperoni would make it too salty, but it really just added an extra little zing of taste to each bite.  The boys are not pepperoni lovers at all, but my 6-year-old even asked for thirds (which he did not get, obviously)!  The cheese layer is perfectly baked, and the eggs actually add another dimension of flavor to it.  It takes forever to throw together, but it is SO WORTH IT!!!  I will be making this again and again.  I'm thinking I could start putting it all together the night before and then just throw it in the oven when I get home after work.  The only change I made was to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  With the pepperoni and then the addition of salt already, I thought the garlic salt would be overkill.  Oh, and I subbed ground turkey for ground beef, as usual.  I also used the tiny pepperonis instead of the regular-sized ones, so there was at least a little bit of pepperoni in every bite.",2010-03-08

The grater was a tennis racket looking rectangular thing, very old. Not the box graters you see nowadays. I have no idea where you would find one, but if you did you would be rich indeed.

And pretty too...garlic had nice golden color.  Note - watch and stir often so the garlic does not get too browned.  I was disappointed that the oil didn't absorb more of the garlic and pepper flavor, but the garlic cloves were heavenly!

309135,486725,4,1,"These tasted really good, though I think that it takes some practice to get them to look like the photos from 2Bleu's clan. Mine were much flatter, and more of the consistency of foccacia. The first four steps are quick and easy, the boiling is the trickiest part. Even though 3 bagels fit comfortably in my large wok, I think it would have been easier to flip them, have them keep their shape, and get them in and out of the boiling water with only one or two bagels. I chose the refrigerator option, which worked well, they rose a little bit more overnight. I used nonstick cooking spray for the glaze, which gave it a nice little crunch. I made it easy on myself and just used the same pan and silpat for the rises, shaping, storing in the frig, and baking (with no problems). Of the flavors I made, sun dried tomato was the unanimous first choice, other favorites were kalamata olive and everything, with dried onion and (fresh) garlic ranking behind those. As a first timer bagel maker, this took me about 2.5 hours from start to finish, including rise time. So it takes a bit of time, but they do taste yummy.",2008-06-17

My husband was amazed that is how bagels were made.  I made only half the recipe but made 7 bagels out of it.  I might try to make it all whole wheat next time and add some gluten, too.

Brushed on a wash of egg white and a bit of water, and baked on silpat mats, 35 minutes for my oven.  Boiled using 2 dutch ovens, 3 per pot fit well.

Now I can't wait to try other flavors/toppings. The possiblities are endless! I want to include some comments from my kids. My daughter came in to help me make these bagels because it looked like ""fun"". We both ended up having a blast. They are really not that difficult to make and you won't believe how good they taste. I gave my son a taste of a bagel, still warm, and amid his ""mmmmmms"" he said, ""make this EVERY weekend...EVERY weekend!"" To sum it up, my daughter said, ""I just can't believe we made bagels!"" Notes: 1. I used a candy thermometer to make sure the water was the right temp. for the yeast to react. 2. All the kneading was done with my stand mixer with dough hook attachment (you could probably use the regular attachment if you don't have the hook). 3. I used the finger in the middle method (this was esp. fun to do with kids). 4. I made 8 large bagels. 5. I used the cooking spray glaze method. 6. I used the steam method by placing a cast iron skillet on the bottom rack while the oven was preheating and when I put the bagels into the oven, I put about 6 ice cubes into the cast iron pan to get the steam (I did not spray the oven walls).",2009-12-31

55325,101823,4,1,"I cut the recipe in half to serve only Hubby and myself.  I used a small casserole dish, but think that the idea of using a loaf pan (as another reviewer mentioned) would have been better.  My oatmeal had a great flavor, but was not creamy or custardy as I would expect ""creme brulee style"" to suggest.  I did use old fashioned oats, which might have contributed to the heartier consistency.  The caramelized sugar on top is a nice touch.  I added raisins and milk to my bowl.  Hubby ate his with just milk.  Very filling and tasty breakfast.",2005-01-16
55325,157248,5,1,"I had never had baked oatmeal before trying this recipe, was it ever good! I added a jar of peaches, and reduced the milk to 3c, it was probably a little moister than it should have been, but I loved it, if you are adding fruit, and don't like moist oatmeal, you may want to reduce the milk a bit more. I will definatly make this many more times! Thanks!",2005-01-22
55325,13483,5,1,Good and easy.  I did add some chocolate chips and it made this rather desserty!!  And what's wrong with that!!  Thanks peachez,2005-04-26
55325,133174,5,1,"After seeing Bev's wonderful photo, I knew I had to give this a try.  I reduced the recipe to serve 2 and used Splenda in the dry mix.  The dish was cooked in less time than indicated but possibly was a result of the reduced quantity.  I used the full amount of brown sugar on the top and instead of placing it under the broiler used my brulee torch to caramelize the sugar.  Next time around I think I will add some of the options mentioned as well as reducing the sugar on top.  A delicious recipe!",2006-01-08
55325,37072,4,1,This very good and makes a filling breakfast.  I added a little cinnamon and some raisins.  I used less than 1/3 c. of Splenda and found that it could have been a little sweeter for our tastes.,2006-04-01
55325,205730,5,1,"I love this recipe!  I scaled it for one person, so it cooks in much less time, but I have it very often for breakfast!  Remember to grease/oil your pan, because it will be a crusty mess if you don't (not that I have experience ;)",2006-11-17
55325,333329,5,1,"This recipe was easy to prepare and had great taste. I added cinnamon and nutmeg for extra spice. I used a jelly roll pan because my 9 x 13 pan was in use elsewhere. This made for a more dense texture than I would have liked. Next time, I will use the 9 x 13 pan or even a deeper casserole dish to achieve a more custard-like texture. The taste is great though, and everyone loved it.",2006-11-28
55325,402559,5,1,Excellent flavor and very moist. My 2 year old preferred this to the flavored oatmeal packets. Thanks for sharing.,2007-01-05
55325,13796,3,0,"Mmm... I thought this was really good. It was a little too sweet for me as I subbed Splenda for the sugar. I added dried fruit so maybe that had something to do with it. I halved the recipe and baked it in a loaf pan. Next time I'll just cut back on both sugars and I know it will be fine.
It was very good.",2007-01-06
55325,340576,5,1,"This is SO heavenly, and unbelievably easy to make! I added drained, diced peaches -- I'm always trying to sneak fruit or veggies into my kids. I've made it several times now, both with regular sugar & brown sugar, and with  Splenda and Splenda-blend brown sugar. Delicious!",2007-03-22
55325,182624,3,0,We really liked this oatmeal.  It's very easy to make and has a good flavor.  It would also be a nice addition to a small brunch menu if you had overnight guests.  We served with fresh blueberries.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!,2007-07-13
55325,283834,5,1,"This is a wonderful Sunday morning meal! I made a double batch last Sunday and refridgerated most of it for breakfasts throughout the week. If you do this, then make sure you add some milk when re-heating it or it will be dry. Also, this makes way more than 4-6 servings. I got easily 15 servings out of a double batch, probably more like 18. So, one batch would be more like 10-12 servings. With a glass of milk it's a full meal! I made it exactly as described but also added some shredded apple and cinnamon and I'm glad I did. Thank you very much!",2007-10-23
55325,205028,5,1,Great recipe. I added shredded apples to the recipe. I was wonderful. I had plenty of leftovers for the rest of the week.,2008-02-28
55325,841096,5,1,"This recipe is delicious!  I substituted 1/3 cup granulated Splenda to make it more Core-friendly.  I still used the brown sugar on top, since that gives it a nice caramelized flavor.  It definitely has the distinctive taste of creme brulee.  And the oatmeal gives it almost a rice pudding-like consistency.  Even my husband liked this, and he hates oatmeal.  Very tasty!",2008-06-02
55325,160974,5,1,"This is so fabulous! I did use 1/2 cup of French Vanilla coffee creamer in place of some milk and it added a wonderful flavor. I took this out of the oven about 7 minutes early. Do not overbake or it will not be creamy! I loved that it didn't need minding. This is great warm or cold and we had it for our breakfast, snack, and dessert today!
Update: I make this without the brown sugar and serve warm with blueberry sauce for a hearty snack/dessert.

55325,134289,5,1,Yummy!!  I added cinnamon and 2 very ripe bananas to this recipe.  This recipe is very easy to put together.  I used the old fashioned oatmeal and it worked out fine. Without a doubt I will make this again.,2008-07-27
55325,424696,5,1,"This is not your traditional ""baked oatmeal"" - cakelike bars.  This was a jazzed up warm gooey oatmeal dish.  We loved it, especially my husband!  We use the recipe #58309 for our baked oatmeal ""bar"" fix and use this one when we are craving traditional cooked oatmeal.  Thanks!",2008-08-31
55325,970864,5,1,This is a keeper!  My boyfriend has already asked for it again. A coworker asked for the recipe.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg.,2008-11-06
55325,352845,5,1,"I am most definitely NOT an oatmeal person, especially those packets.  I went on a search to find a baked oatmeal I might like.   LOVED it!!

Thanks for a great recipe!!",2008-11-09

55325,422609,5,1,"For me, this is one of those recipes that I will make over and over and over ... maybe adding in different things, like raisins, cranberries, peaches, cherries, chocolate, etc.  Even without any ""add-ins"", I could eat the entire dish when it emerges warm from the oven.  The aroma alone is intoxicating.  Warm, sweet, vanilla-y ... it is just SO good!  Like comfort in a bowl.",2009-12-15
55325,722619,4,1,"Very good! I downsized the recipe to 2 servings, and I cooked it a lil too long because the center was not 'jiggly' but the taste is still great.  This is a keeper and will make again and had my own spin on it!",2010-01-17
55325,577585,5,1,Yum and so easy. I haven't even tried adding fruits or nuts yet.,2010-04-05
55325,486725,5,1,"I think this is 4.5 stars, but would be 5 if I had used a loaf pan for a half recipe. I usually use an 8x8, but because there is no baking powder in this, it was very thin (I can't believe a beloved brulee topping could ever be too much for me, but it was with such a thin layer!). I love Recipe #189837, so the loaf should make it more like that. I cut back the sugar by 20%, but should have done more for our tastes. I also followed other reviewers and cut back the milk by a third, baked it 25 minutes, and used my brulee torch. Very yummy. Would have served 3-4 for a full recipe.",2010-04-10
55325,321999,4,1,I don't like oatmeal and still thought this was very good.  It doesn't have that make you gag mushy oatmeal texture and that is great.  It was more like a crisp.  I can't wait to try again with some blueberries mixed in.  I placed in ramikins and baked 40 minutes.,2010-06-05

196554,470856,5,1,I loved this soup and couldn't stop eating it.  I'd never heard of Christmas Eve soup but found the recipe while searching for a way to use up some sauerkraut juice and I also happened to have a lot of mushrooms in the house.  I scaled it down a lot to make only 2 servings and only used about 1 tablespoon of butter total but it turned out just great. This recipe is a definite keeper.,2011-09-26
196554,1362836,5,1,"Just finished making our version, which came from my Grandmother. I also dried my own mushrooms, although Costco now carries a nice package. We add spaezle, or little dumplings that are dropped into the hot soup. The person is right about loving or hating it. But once it becomes a tradition, you can&#039;t wait to have it again. I may add a tad of fresh dill this year.",2014-12-24

130782,226989,4,1,I enjoyed this and so did my husband. We made it without beer (last minute choice)and it was fine. I also whipped up a quick Thai peanut sauce for dipping. I did find it a bit too sweet from the coconut.,2005-08-05

424200,324970,5,1,I took these to a Boy Scout Leaders Meeting and they were a big hit with everyone.  I love peanut clusters as it is and with the marshmallow in there its an added bonus cause they are soft and chewy.  Yum Yum!!  Took me about 15 minutes to make.  I want to use cashews next time.  I dropped them on parchment paper with a tablespoon and maybe could have used my smallest scooper from pampered chef to dish them out.  They are sticky till set and i used non stick spray on parchment paper.  Worked great.,2010-06-06

I made as written with the exception of a pinch of cayenne for zing, I used low fat velveeta, which I didn't have much hope for, but I'd failed so many times I thought, ""what the heck.""

Just enough to brown the top.  The mac and cheese was very creamy and the top had the cheesy crust that I love.  I also recommend using a pretty strong cheese.

After following all the instructions here, I like to put everything in a caserole dish, add a bit more shredded cheese on top and then throw it in the oven for 20 min or so at 350.  This way the top is all crusty and fantastic.  But if we're in a rush, it's great just the way it is too.",2010-12-28

There 4 of us and there was only enough left for a plate to make my son for his lunch next day. My youngest son said it was the best Mac and cheese he ever had.  I had to use Bisquik for the flour as I didn't have flour on hand and I used half whipping cream and milk for a richer flavor and I also used sharp cheddar cheese.  I did place it in a baking dish and baked it at 375' for 20 minutes til it started to bubble. Let stand out of oven for 10 minutes to cool down before serving.

I didn't have plain applesauce, only strawberry flavored (in the individual serving size)but it didn't make a noticeable difference.  I will add extra applesauce next time so that we can taste it.  The blue cheese is such a nice flavor, but it did drown out the apple.  That's definately not a complaint tho!  I served the pork with a caesar salad and garlic bread.

Because my Mom &amp; Dad are arriving to visit me from Ontario (home!) and I&#039;ll be seeing them for the first time in a year (!!), I wanted to make something special that they&#039;d like - so, I changed the flour ratio to 3/4 cup all-purpose and 3/4 cup spelt (Mom started my education on whole grain breads and flours when I was a wee girl, much to my embarrassment at school!  Everyone else had Nutella and Fluff on Wonder, and I had fresh ground no-sugar-added PB on whole wheat!  The horror!)  ANYWAY!  The flour changed worked out lovely, and Mikekey, this is a definite HIT!  Oh - I did add 3/4 cup pecans, because, well, no banana bread ever came without nuts in our house!  I wanted to do walnuts, but I couldn&#039;t find them.  Oh, and instead of the cloves and nutmeg, I used mixed spice - that was sheer laziness, because I know I have cloves and nutmeg... but I laid my hand on mixed spice first, and hey, mixed spice HAS cloves and nutmeg in it - well, at least this organic version does.  :oops:  As I do with all of my quick breads, muffins, and many of my scones, a covering of recipe #297272 by Starrynews was shaken on top before it hit the oven.  :o)  This is a very versatile recipe, and will be made again and again!

Thanks, Jim for sharing your recipe. I will be using it again on those 2 bags of hot dog buns I have in my freezer.",2009-01-03

16245,6357,3,0,"These cookies were something different. But, I'd like to make a few suggestions based on how I made them today.
Firstly, on mixing the dry ingredients with the butter-oil mixture, I didn't get a soft dough. What I got was something similar to ""boondis"" i.e., small round balls. I made these into round balls(just like we make ladoos) and then baked them for 24 minutes. Once these were cooled, I dipped them in the topping.
For the topping, I suggest to heat sugar and water together and once the sugar has melted, to add the honey. Allow to simmer for 2-3 minutes.
Then, dip the cooled cookies into this syrup and after removing from the syrup, arrange in a serving tray/dish and then sprinkle with nuts.
Initially, I made the topping as the recipe says, but the problem was that the whole thing hardened up within seconds and made it very difficult for me. That's why I came up with the idea mentioned above. 
Another thing, I could make only 1 dozen cookies and not 3 dozen as per the measurements mentioned in this recipe.
Overall, it was okie, something different from usual cookies.",2001-12-27

104773,73988,4,1,"We made these rolls for Freezer Tag to see if they're suitable for OAMC.  
First, the rolls themselves are great!  These soft yeast rolls have  a wonderful, smooth, light consistency, and the hint of citrus is delicious!  My husband and I agree that they'd be best for us more as a coffee cake than a dinner roll (though that didn't seem to stop us from eating them both with dinner and with breakfast!).  
When it came to cutting the dough circles into wedges, I found that a pizza cutter worked best.  And although the recipe says it makes 48 servings, it only makes 24 rolls,  and I'm not sharing mine!  :lol:
So. . . we made the recipe as written, then, when we had shaped the rolls, we took 8 rolls and froze them on a tray  (once they were frozen, we put them in a zip-top freezer bag for storage).  To  bake - while still frozen, we put the rolls on a parchment-lined sheet, covered, and let them thaw and rise for about 2 hours, then baked as directed.  
The remaining rolls, (16 of the 24) we baked immediately, as directed, and when done, we had some for dinner and froze the rest.  The frozen rolls were just as good as they were fresh.
So, overall, these rolls work just fine to freeze ahead, either to bake and freeze, or to freeze unbaked, then bake when needed, which takes less time when preparing, but more planning to do, but either way, they're darn tasty. :)",2008-03-09

17583,2000839762,4,1,Works good I&#039;m a novice cook but coming from North East Scotland and having lived their all my life then I&#039;ve eaten my fair share of these. Taste good. Will get my Mum to help me hone my skills. I&#039;ll just say to anyone not from North East Scotland you need medium grade Scottish oatmeal not porridge oats (which is what I think Americans call oatmeal). It wouldn&#039;t work the same at all I think then.  The ingredients form into a grand dough and is very workable so it this doesn&#039;t happen you are probably using the wrong stuff :),2016-01-26

351608,1407817,4,1,This was really good. After I added sour cream and cheese and guacamole with some rice tossed in there it resembled a Chipoltle burrito. Next time I would reduce the amount of barley and add more beans.,2009-12-27

We are vegan so this fits into our daily eating habits.  We usually have it as soft tacos the first night and then I freeze the rest and make green enchilada casserole a few weeks later by filling tortillas with it and covering with our favorite enchilada sauce.  It is my family's favorite filling.  You will not be disappointed.,2010-01-06

I made 12 big muffins with this, but the batter would have easily made 18. Still baked up fine at 350 for 30 minutes. Oh and for the grated chocolate, I used chocolate chips. I guess I didn't follow everything *exactly* but my subs aren't anything too far out of the spirit of the original. Despite the cup of sugar, these aren't too sweet. Perfect in fact!",2010-08-08

38962,28604,5,1,"This was great! I seriously had more than half of the dish- the flavor was perfect for my taste buds! Plus, it was very eye pleasing with the colors- red and green and the fresh color of the noodles...Speaking of noodles, I used (4 cups worth when they weren't cooked yet) wide egg noodles and they worked perfectly. I also only used a pound of ground beef (I made two dishes, each using a pound...) I used a whole green pepper and chopped it up, didn't use the kidney beans, and did add a splash of soy sauce (I thought that I was putting the sauce into the other dish I was making!) So, although it looks like a changed a lot of things, I didn't notice that I may have until I was typing this! Well, I loved this so much--I am definately making this again!

Subbed 1/2 of a 1 lb container of sour cream for the canned evaporated milk, not big on cans. It's fabulous; I am thinking of substituting ramps for the leeks, come the spring.

The butter and broth made a nice, silky sauce that coated the vegetables, and the rosemary added a nice background flavor.

Anyway, I cut it down and it worked perfect. I was concerned when I first started to assemble them because I thought they would be dry. But they weren't. I was surprised that the butter mixture and the mustard mixture measurements were spot on. This is what kept the sandwiches from being dry. The only negative I could think of would be the shredded lettuce, it was a bit difficult to keep on top of the biscuit so next time I think I would just us a piece of lettuce. What an outstanding party recipe. This is a keeper. Oh, forgot to say the flavor is wonderful, and I used 1/2 stone ground mustard and 1/2 Dijon mustard. The butter/mustard mixture is what makes the overall flavor of these sandwiches the talk of the PARTY! Thanks for posting. :)",2009-12-06

When making these, I found that I needed more than 1 cup of peanut butter to make the ingredients hold together, but that is probably because I used crunchy style.

In the sauce I also added some heavy cream as I used no cheese at all, this is a rich dish and I felt the cheese was not needed with the cream, sherry, and nutmeg. It was fabulous!

I used to have a similar recipe that had about half as much garlic and about 1/2 cup balsamic... it's much better in a different proportion... now I just need to experiment and get it right. Thanks for giving a good set of ingredients that I know will be fabulous once I can figure out the correct ratios.

As the meat,onions, and garlic were cooking, a bit of seasoning salt and ground black pepper were added while the meat was cooking. The amounts for the "" Seasoning Mixture "" were changed just a bit due to mine and my SO's tastes,the Worcestershire sauce was reduced to 1 Tblsp. and 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper was used. The amount of celery salt was replaced with an equal amount of celery powder.  I didn't have the 28oz.can of tomatoes, so 1 14.5 ounce can of chili seasoned tomatoes and 1 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes that had green peppers  & onions were used.Also, I didn't have chili beans, so I used the same size can of red kidney beans.Since I used a can of tomatoes that had green peppers in it, the diced green peppers were omitted.

I also added a bay leaf and some peppercorns, as I think they enhance these types of soups. I used a bit more tomato paste. The sour cream adds such a wonderful taste to the soup. Interestingly, I did not really taste the lime the day I made this, but it seemed more evident the next day, when I had the leftovers for lunch. I can see adding a little meat to this to make it more of a main-dish soup - you would not need a lot, with the barley providing so much nutrition.",2013-01-15

I carmelized the onions and didn't have any poppy seeds.  It was simple and the onion mixture tasted good.  I wasn't thrilled with the bisquit taste combined with the onions (those bisquits just have an aftertaste I'm not fond of and they were a little crusty hard on the bottoms).

Will definitely make again since it is so easy.  Just wondering how it would work with a Southwester Marinade or the Lemon Pepper variety!

243315,451605,3,0,"These tarts are certainly tasty but I found the coffee liqueur to be over powering so that I couldn't detect the maple at all. If I prepare these again, I would definitely cut the liqueur in 1/2 or omit it. I was looking forward to the maple flavor. I prepared the large but thin type of tart, which made 6. I lowered teh oven temp to 425 for 8 mins to start as my oven runs a wee bit on the high side. I then cooked them a further  8 mins @ 350. They tested done (knife test) but later upon tasting, I was surprised that they didn't have the same texture as 'butter' tarts, which is what I had expected. This is not a bad think - the texture is excellent but don't expect a really sweet and almost gooey-ish experience. I do like them but for me personally, I'd most likely omit the liqueur and increase teh maple syrup slightly while also adding a bit of maple flavoring.
Thank you for this treat!!

67994,67728,5,1,"Made this for PAC Spring 2007 -- Oh wow, these were good!! I think I like these even better than traditional s'mores! I used Anna's Ginger Thins for the cookies, and Dickinson's Lemon Curd. I was at work (as usual), and didn't have access to any open flame other than a lab burner (ick), so I put the marshmallows on half of the cookies, nuked for 15 seconds, then topped them with the other snaps which were spread with the lemon curd. Very nice flavor combination.

81966,324136,4,1,"I have to admit that I didn't make this to recipe, so that may account for a few problems! I made this a few times to get it right. I used rye flour instead of all purpose as my BIL is allergic to wheat. The first time I made it, the base seemed VERY oily when I brought it out of the pans.  So the next time I made it I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I also only used 3 whole eggs and 5 egg whites to make it a little lighter, and 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup sweetner.  I also had only 9 inch pans, and when I made it the first time they were a little thin so the next time I made quantities for 4 cakes and spread it between 3 pans.  Overall the flavour was great (not sure how much kirsch I used- probably too much!)  To use up the first lot of cakes, I mixed jam with a little kirsch and sandwiched the cakes together (like a Sacher torte).  DH enjoyed this for his morning tea!  And the finished cake was a good birthday cake for my sister.  With a 9 inch pan it easily made 10 pieces.",2006-09-12

Have made it as posted - as well as doubling using the larger 9 inch spring form pan using two layers. Along with a good quality cocoa - using a good quality chocolate makes for those wonderful curls. A dessert to turn to when you want an impressive dessert for those special occasions.

Coming from the northeast coast ( now homesteading in rural Missouri) I had not become aquainted with that cut of the other ""white"" meat.  Tried another recipe, just didn't do it for me, great flavor, just too tough.  I figured braising was the key.  Researched Zaar and found your recipe.  WOW, the flavor and so tender.  The only addition was I added some brown sugar to the sauce as the vinegar was a little too tangy for my taste buds and I threw in some peeled and guartered potatoes.

I used home dried serranos for the chilli flakes and could only use 4 of those and it was perfectly heated for me.  Husband would like it hotter, but then no one else could eat it.  Since it was only the two of us I used two 1 1/2-2 inch pork loin chops but kept the sauce the same.  No leftovers :) Was thinking ""I wonder why kit didn't saute the bells with the onions and garlic"", but Kit knows best:) Also I believe this could be done in a crock pot, after browning the chops.  I did cook it for the one hour covered, but when I went and uncovered them they were done and almost falling off the bone.  So, I probably will cut the time down next time.  I served this over rice with steamed broccoli on the side.  The sauce was good over the broccoli also :)  Thank you Kit for posting this delicious recipe.  Shirl",2007-04-06

I really think I may have only had maybe 20-25 minutes in prep time and I thought it came together really quickly!  It was perfect on a Friday night after the work week - what a treat!",2007-02-12
159032,280166,4,1,My husband and I loved this dish!  I added mushroom and red bell pepper strips.  The prep on this was much quicker than 45 mins and that included slicing the extra mushrooms and red peppers.  Thanks for posting!,2007-07-27

507217,560491,5,1,This was so easy to make and so tasty too!  Made a serving for 2 and it was more than enough for DH and I.  I didn&#039;t have frozen peas and carrots so I diced some carrots and steamed them for a few minutes to soften and then added so they wouldn&#039;t be too crunchy in the end.  Made for My Three Chefs.,2013-10-27

159032,47233,4,1,"This recipe is absolutely fabulous. I have cooked 3 times to 3 different sets of people and all commented this dish is absolutely fabulous! The only thing I did different was to cook the shrimps with the shell on (not too long) to give the sauce a bit more flavour, remove them from the sauce and shell them. Then, towards the end of it, I would put the shrimps back to heat up with the pasta. In this way, the shrimps won't be overcooked.",2007-12-18

(btw, I'm thinking of modifying my posted recipe to include the fresh tomatoes)  For this dish I used a whole pound of linguine and doubled up on the sauce. I also added a few chopped cloves of garlic and some lemon, as another reviewer suggested.  I found that the dried parsley that I had on hand worked very well too.  I didn't have any parmesan, but we didn't miss it at all.  A real winner! Thanks!",2009-09-25

284454,167236,5,1,"Made for PAC, Fall 2011. Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best: 3 ingredients and 20 minutes ... but what you get is so much better than the bottled kind or what comes from the deli. We made these for a Middle-Eastern themed dinner, but it could have been any Mediterranean or Italian dinner. The peppers were tender, with just a hint of carmelization, offset by the sweet, slightly tangy taste of the balsamic vinegar, all with a great mouth feel.<br/><br/>Wonderful antipasti, but it could easily be an added ingredient to a lunch salad. This stores well (as the recipe indicates, at least a week refrigerated.

I had trouble getting the cinnamon to blend in so I warmed the dressing in the microwave for about 15 seconds. It was just enough to make it come together perfectly.

Maybe I put a bit too much flour on as some of it just stayed as it was and didn't get soaked up whilst in the oven. However I don't want to sound too negative as it was a good recipe!

Wrong.  I baked until it was quite brown on the bottom, almost 20 minutes, and the taste of yeast was overpowering.

137111,72254,3,0,"First off, I was a bit confused to what, ""flatten as much as possible"" meant. As flat as pizza dough or thicker? But noticing that scoring was needed I patted it down to about 1 1/2 inch. It baked up nicely, but a bit dense (which was fine with me), although I wasn't sure if it was the way it's suppose to be. The taste was very nice. Not 'yeasty' at all. It went very well with my Lamb and Pear Tagine (which I've submitted to Zaar and am currantly awaiting approval from the elves.) Perfect for sopping up the juices:-) This was my first time to make Moroccan flatbread and not my last.
I'm submitting a photo's to let you know how it turned out.  I hope I did it justice.  Thanks Hajar, for an easy and tasty recipe.

The mom of the house made her bread from scratch at least 2 times a week. I actually helped knead the bread in attempt to learn. When i was making this bread from your recipe, It was really sticky which made it very hard to ""pull, stretch, and flatten.

137111,1291036,5,1,What a wonderful bread recipe!  It has a light texture and is the softest bread I've ever made - it has the closest resemblance to commercially-produced bread that I've come across so far.  I used a breadmaker to make the dough through to the first rising then did the second rising in the oven.  (I also halved the recipe as I wasn't sure the a whole recipe would fit in the breadmaker.  I was really surprised at how much I got with only half the amount.)  I've also made it quite successfully in a loaf tin to get a conventionally-shaped loaf rather than the flat loaf.,2009-06-08

The dough seemed very wet when it came out of the machine, but the finished product was just perfect- great flavor, great texture.

The taste was great but next time I will cook it at a higher temperature and make smaller round loaves like she does. Moroccans like more crust, less spongy inside, to be able to eat with it. I made this in my bread machine, the mixing, kneading and rising, and then just laid it out on a cookie sheet and rolled it out with a handheld roller. So easy! I always thought this bread was so time-consuming! Thank you for this version!",2010-07-01

There&#039;s only 2 of us so half of the dough I froze after the first rise and will be interested to see how that works out when I defrost it and maybe I&#039;ll try to roll it out even thinner next time.  My dough was really sticky (couldn&#039;t even knead it) so I did add about an extra 1/4 cup of flour so that I could form a dough.

83765,242766,4,1,"These rolls were delicious. The reason I am giving this recipe 4*'s is because some of the ingredient amounts and recipe directions were too vague. I felt that if someone new to making cinnamon rolls tried to make these rolls, they might becomed confused. Also, I think that the extra 3 TBS. of water is unnecessary (the dough was batter-like and impossible to knead). I ended up using approx. 1/4 c. more flour to get the dough to kneading consistency. Next time, I would eliminate the 3 TBS. water and add any additional water, if needed, to make the dough easy to knead. I will include the steps that I did, in hopes that it might help someone else when making this recipe: 
After kneading dough and allowing it to raise, on a floured surface, roll out the dough into a 12""x18"" rectangle. Spread 2 TBS. softened butter or margarine over the rectangle. In a small bowl, mix together 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, and 1 tsp. cinnamon. Sprinkle this mixture over the buttered dough. Roll up dough, starting at the long end, and seal the seam by pinching the dough together. Cut the dough into 1-1/2"" slices (there should be 12 slices), and put the rolls, cut side down, into a greased 9x13"" pan. Raise and bake as directed. After baking, I let the rolls cool, in the pan, for 5 mins. on a cooling rack. I frosted the warm rolls with ""half"" a recipe of cream cheese frosting from my recipe #142070 recipe. The end result was some very yummy rolls that my family loved.",2007-01-24
144595,197023,5,1,"Wow, Karen=^..^=, thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I’ve never made pumpkin pie before (it’s a very American thing, after all) but this was indeed an impossibly easy pie to make, and so wonderfully quick to make.  It was scrumptious, so scrumptious in fact that – because I’m currently on the Healthy for the Holidays Challenge II – after sampling a piece, I left what was left of it after five of us had enjoyed a piece, at my parents’ place for them to enjoy!  They loved it too, except that the 85 year old grumpikins, who is at his happiest when he is complaining, said he’d prefer it “without the nuts”.  He still ate them, however!  My mother and two friends who had dropped in and I all l-o-v-e-d the pecans!  I had to improvise several ingredients because they just aren’t readily available here.  I made the pie using Lali’s Bisquick Clone Recipe #12648 and home-cooked mashed pumpkin and the pumpkin pie spice mix on Zaar.  For the topping, I whipped some low fat ricotta with the extra pumpkin pie spice.  I also used a low fat evaporated milk, so maybe I could have eaten a second slice.  I’m going to make this again for Christmas Day!",2005-12-03

The only thing I messed up on and it's really no big thing was that I melted the chocolate and then put the cool whip on top. It was hard to get all the melted chocolate off the bottom of the bowl. But that's what happens when you are making three things at once and reading off the computer in another room!! Still it was very delicious and easy to make. Love this recipe!!!,2007-03-31

It hardened into little flecks pretty quickly instead of being smooth.  It happened both times I tried it.

321857,174096,5,1,Delicious!  We quite enjoyed the addition of the coriander and cumin.  Very good!  Thanks for sharing!,2010-03-21
321857,1755180,5,1,Delicious and so easy to make. I used the Velveeta Queso Cheese and I have only had rave reviews. The coriander and cumin make the dish unique but I cut back to one tablespoon. since I was only using a very small crock pot.,2012-12-31
281341,143917,4,1,We enjoyed this bread a lot.  I had originally planned to cut the recipe in half.  I am so glad I didn't because I shared the other loaves with friends.  They loved it too. Reviewed for PAC Spring 2008,2008-04-20
281341,522099,4,1,"A good solid Italian bread.  It makes a bunch at one time, and I would recommend freesing the dough in loaves at step 9 for OAMC, then thaw and continue as written.  Pre-baked frozezn is okay, but all bread loses something in the freezer so I would say freeze the baked bread as a last resort.
My usual recipe doesn't use honey and this seemed to add a slightly different sweetness to the bread than my usual sugar.  Could it be because I used wilflower honey?  In any case it was tasty!",2008-04-28

I think next time i might add some thyme to the stuffing, maybe a little Parmesan and perhaps some very thinly sliced red onion or chopped shallots. Used half and half.

243225,15521,5,1,"Nice, fresh and unique salad.  This was the fist time I have had a salad that was all arugula.  It was a little overpowering for me, but I will assume that others enjoy that peppery flavor when rating this recipe. I loved the dressing!  What a great, healthy way to dress up a salad!  It was delicious!  I didn't have white balsamic vinegar so used regular balsamic vinegar and it worked fine.  I am asssuming that it might just change the color of the dressing a bit. I wasn't as crazy about the salad mixture, but I think that is personal preference.  I might omit the jicama and replace half the arugula with romaine or red leaf lettuce.  As I said before, the arugula flavor was a bit much for me.  I used raspberries as my additional fruit.  We had picked up some arugula at the farmers market and wanted to try it out.  I am glad we chose this recipe and will definitely try it again!",2011-05-23

I took it to a girls' event and my husband took it to a guys' event and it was loved by all! It is a ""safe"" recipe that everyone will like-if I made it again for an adventurous group, I'd try adding chili powder and cumin or a packet of taco seasoning. By the way, we also took JenniferK2's suggestion and slathered this on flour tortillas and grilled in the panini maker; the resulting quesadillas were WONDERFUL...highly recommended!",2008-05-14

While we all love cheese wouldn't add the cheese on top but layer it inside as one of your previous reviewers. Everyone liked the rice that we too use when we do stuffed peppers.

I used creamy peanut butter and pushed the two bottoms of the crackers together (I'm not sure if that was right, but I figured it gave the most coin-like shape). Next time I'll melt my butterscotch chips just a tad more, as it was easier to spread than it was to dunk this time around. They still turned out very clever looking (I'll try to take a pic next time) and tasted so yummy with the butterscotch and the wafer-like crunch! I craved a second one 1 hour after my first! Thank you for the cute idea!
**Update-I made these again and still have a hard time getting the butterscotch to form a fully smooth outside to the coins. Please let me know if you have any suggestions. In the meantime, they're still adorable and they taste outrageously good! :D",2009-12-13

The only changes I made was to give the chicken a spray with cooking spray (if doing that add the spare crumbs after spraying) and I left the skin on, otherwise I think I may have a revolt on my hands :lol:, I would also recommend that you do not dip chilled chicken into the butter as it ceases up the melted butter (take out of the fridge about 30 minutes before dipping - you can always put back into the fridge after crumbing which I would also recommend to help them set).

I roughly doubled the recipe because I had quite a few pickles come in from the garden.  The pickle/onion/pepper mixture easily filled 3 quart jars, but the brine covered only one with just a little to spare, so I had to make another double batch of brine.

I forgot the cleaning out of the peppers. Surprise! Surprise! I was looking for a dish that I could use leftover chicken. I came across this and said to self (that's me) I could do this with leftovers. It worked great. I skipped the cooking process of the chicken and went to the tomatoe's and mushrooms.

During the last 5 minutes after taking off the lid, I added the sauce....and presto! Yum yum!! The only thing I would change next time (yes, there will be a next time) is to blanch the peppers in boiling water for 1 minute prior to stuffing. This way the peppers will be a tiny bit softer.

I blanched the peppers for five minutes. Next time I will do for 10 minutes so they will be a little softer. Put green enchilada sauce at the bottom of a 9x13. Stuffed peppers.

233392,200862,3,0,"MADE FOR ZWT4. First off: this is the kind of recipe I like to make. And it has the potential to become a great recipe! But as it stands, it needs editing. The amounts given are all correct, and made the right consistency white sauce. But I found the instructions confusing -- the filling should be made before one starts on the souffle roll itself. The flour should be added to the milk (for the souffle sauce), not the other way round, which easily causes lumps. Also, one should let the white sauce cool a little before beating in the 4 egg yolks, or the yolks might curdle. Then, there should be a warning to drain the  shrimps after cooking them in the wine! A novice cook will come unstuck here: I drained off 1 1/4 cups fluid from the wine and the shrimps!  Only then could the bechamel sauce be added, to make the filling. Also, tasting as I cooked, I realised this recipe is very bland. I added a seasoned salt containing finely crushed lime rind, coriander seeds and hot pepper. (I should have thought of adding fish sauce too). This recipe uses a lot of bechamel sauce, and I could not face it on top of the roll as well, so only used 1 cup for the filling as instructed, and made do with grated cheddar on top.

179903,419585,5,1,This was absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written here.  I did prepare my eggplant first by salting it to draw out the bitterness which also gives the eggplant more of a chewiness and less of that raw taste.  I used shaved Parmesan which worked just as well as the grated Parma would.  I give this a 5 stars.  It was crispy and savory and went well with the celery root/mashed potatoes I made.  It can also be made vegan using vegan mayo.,2008-02-24

179903,260451,4,1,This was very simple and very good. A nice alternative to eggplant parmesan (which I don't care for). The onion gave it a nice little bite. Next time I may try it with roasted garlic instead of onion for a mellower flavor. Will definitely make this again.,2009-03-12

I lacked cream cheese for the recipe, but I had some leftover Avocado Dip from Recipe #394518 (with Sweet Potato Fries) from the previous night. I mixed that in with the onion and a little over a quarter cup more of mayo. They baked up nice and crispy, but do not keep well for the next day, so eat up same day if possible! I used the Progresso Seasoned bread crumbs (which is strongly flavored on its own), so didn't have to add more Italian seasoning. Very quick and easy! Thanks!",2009-11-20

The reviewer who stated this was not good the next time around maybe needs to look at how much and how they kept it.  I only had two slices left and with the additional time under the ""broiler"" it was welcomed even more so than when I made it last night.  3 stars but I will need to tweak it.",2010-01-13

I looked at him and said ""I haven't added any yet!"" He said ""Well it pretty good anyway"" I served this over rice and some cornbread next to it.

Made it exactly as stated and it smelled fantastic while cooking. Hubby could hardly wait to taste although he had his doubts. Finally, tasting time. I say tasting, but I had to drag him away from the pot otherwise he would have eaten his dinner there and then. It is truly outstanding! Who would have thought that these spices would go so well together. Thumbs up for a great recipe that certainly will be made again.

375061,222478,5,1,Yum!

I added an egg and 1/4 cup milk to the batter, otherwise it would not have been a batter. It was much too dry and crumbly. After adding the two extra ingredients, it was perfect, and the bread turned out fabulous. I left out the chocolate chips and used xylitol instead of sugar. The gluten free flours used: 1/4 cup buckwheat, 1/4 cup sorghum, 1/2 cup brown rice. This combination tends to work out in many baked goods for me and tastes amazing.

Unfortunately, the orange zest overpowered the whole thing making it taste like cleaner to us. I think just the orange juice would have worked or lime juice and zest would have been better. It also needed salt or fish sauce in it. So sorry it didn't work out to our tastes.",2011-08-16

429965,2001415007,4,1,"Good rough stock (broth?) recipe ? I'm confused, it refers to stock with broth as soup?? Nevertheless, without the 'broth' which I presume is what we (uk) call stock,, then,,, you are making stock You will get much more flavour if you roast the veg first on a medium heat for about 30 mins, until they have a nice colour and have softened a bit ( or sweat down the onion in a little olive oil on a low heat until it softens and creates a base flavour) Definitely remove all the chicken meat you can BEFORE or you will boil it to death and it won't be nice after hours of simmering. As long as you cover everything in the pot with COLD water any amount is fine. Bring to the boil, reduce to low low heat and let sit for at least 4 hours, the longer the better. To make this into a simple soup sweat half an onion, chopped, until soft, add cornflour or plain flour (about 1tbsp) gently fry for 1minute , add stock, leftover chicken, heat gently until almost boiling, then add a little cream/s&amp;p etc. To taste Then the noodles :)",2017-03-03

I also degreased it after removing the bones etc. Let it go cold, if you can, put it in the freezer for 15 minutes, then skim off the fat.

Although I didn't have all the ingredients (no carrot or celery), I went ahead and tried it, using Chinese cabbage instead of white or red. It was absolutely delicious! My husband, who doesn't normally like zucchini salad, loved this recipe. The grated zucchini worked well in this recipe - the bonus is that it's much quicker to grate it in the food processor than to julienne it. It also stayed very crispy for 3 days in the frig.

Broccoli was one of the green vegetables of choice for my Designer Thanksgiving Dinner, and what better way to serve broccoli, than with my favourite ""funghi"", portabello.  I had thought of using shitake, but decided the wilting of shitake during cooking would detract from the vibrant broccoli green.  Portabello keeps its shape, especially when sliced thickly...  In place of garlic salt, I added a half dozen thinly sliced garlic cloves for an equally desirable flavour with none of the sodium.  How pretty and so very edible it all looked surrounded by the whites of potatoes, oranges of squash and sanguine beets...

Also stirred in a little curry and topped each bowl with chopped shrimp tossed in sesame oil to give the soup a burst of protein. If you use PB2 in place of the peanut butter, it&#039;s even low-fat!

(didn&#039;t miss it)   In spite of adding the large amount of water, this dish still had plenty of hearty flavor, but I think all that water is unnecessary. I cooked mine for 20 minutes instead of 10, with the lid OFF the whole time so some liquid could cook off, and it was still a very runny sauce. Next time, I&#039;ll try 1 cup water and add more only if needed; I think then the salt could also be decreased. And even though I hate cooked spinach, I could not taste it at all in this dish and think I could safely double the spinach amount. Make it healthier! Delicious!&lt;br/&gt;*Made it again!

Also used flour tortillas instead of corn.  Just spicy enough to please a variety of tastes.  We got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe!!

But today I made a version of the filling and really enjoyed it over rice.  I used 6 chicken breasts,  cubed, browned and set aside, then  sauteed onion, sweet pepper, garlic, canned tomatoes while scraping up the browned bits. Used maybe 2 T cumin, and 1 1/2 dried oregano (not powdered)and 1/2 t red pepper flakes.  Then I added the chicken back in and simmered until cooked through.  To finish I stirred in a 200g (about 8 ounce) package cream cheese and about 2 T diced pickled jalapeno, chopped.

After making this, and putting it in a sealed jar, turn it upside down on the counter top for about a day; long enough for the oil to work its way through the mixture, back to the top.  Turn it upright again, immediately stick in the fridge, and  you don't have to worry about trying to stir it everytime you use it.  ",2005-01-15

No matter, though, it just made it easier to pour into the jar.  I added a little too much peanut oil because I was worrying that it wouldn't really get smooth, but just relax and realize that all the oil that is already in the peanuts needs to come out first.  Mine is just a tad thin.  We also added about a Tbs of honey.  Yum.  The kind of good stuff that makes you want to eat it with a spoon!  :)  I'd like to try this sometime with not just peanuts, but a mix, like peanuts, almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, soynuts.

114557,102058,4,1,"I became little confused after I started making this because the title of the recipe said ""Lemon Cake with..."" but if you look closely it's actually a plain cake as per the instructions. Having fancied a lemon cake, I stole a little of the juice that I'd set aside for the filling and added it to my cake batter and proceded as per the rest of the instructions. As usual with my cakes, it wasn't quite the totally light and airy result that my Grandma could produce blindfolded,(she always said it's how you hold your hand when you fold the wet/dry ingredients together, I obviously never quite hold my hand right) but for my baking skills it turned out remarkably well and I was pretty pleased. (this is no fault of the recipe I assure you)
I questioned the idea of putting icing (frosting) in the middle between the 2nd and 3rd layers, but later when it was cut it made perfect sense and I was glad that I'd followed the instructions to the letter. It was rich and yummy and I took it as dessert to a friend who's invited us and others for lunch, there were 8 adults in total so it divided up very nicely indeed and not a solitary morsel was left.
While the lemon flavour was good, a general comment was made that it was rather sweet, so yes I would definiately make this again, it looked impressive and was popular, but for the sake of our waistlines it will be a special occasion recipe. Please see my rating system: a well deserved 4 stars:)

This worked well, and tasted great. This recipe is a keeper, great to make for special occasions. 
The frosting was delicious, and as I was making it, I couldn't stop licking the spatula! It's a good thing that the recipe made more than enough for a single layer cake, or I might have been in trouble when It came time to frost it!

I actually found a ciabetta loaf, (yeah) it was 300 grams about 10 ounces  so I halved the recipe and it had plenty of filling.  I used a cheddar cheese because Monterey jack pepper cheese is not available in Australia.  I also used regular green chilli's because I couldn't find chipotle chilies.  Thank you MamaJ",2008-01-28

We used regular cheddar because pepper jack is hard to find here (I need another trip to the US I think!). DH rated this as awesome, but I didn't like that the toasting to melt the cheese hardened the edges of the bread to a very hard consistancy. The taste however was great!

Then I discovered when rolling them up that if I put a thin layer of beans all over the tortilla, then a layer of cheese on only half of it, but then roll it cheese half first, the cheese gets pushed along, the whole thing gets filled, but you have a firmer roll that is easier to cut.

We will make this again. 
I found that for my preferance I would rather do the sauce by itself to keep it that nice white color. 
I also had to add cornstarch because I had to use Soy Cream (DH's problem) which meant it wouldn't thickened as planned. It was still tasty, although probably a bit sweeter than it should have been.

(after the potluck there was a lot of naked lettuce left in the bottom of the bowl that no one wanted) and make sure you use the taco seasoning!! no one could believe the dressing was just hidden valley mixed with taco seasoning! genious!! ps: that is a whole lot of avocado- which i happen to love) but if youre not into it as much as i am you might want to just use one.",2005-03-23

Many thanks.",2002-07-14

After the garlic settled to the bottom of the oil, I used just the flavored oil to rub the salmon. Also, set the grill hotter to produce a little smoke. Everything worked out fine.",2003-06-29

28813,101053,5,1,"I made this today, and it was fantastic!  I used melted butter rather than the oil and jazzed up the seasonings a little.  I would suggest preheating the cedar plank a bit longer (10 to 15 minutes) to get the smoke going.  Wonderful flavor!",2005-06-26
28813,185285,5,1,"Oh, THANK YOU for the fantasticly specific instructions. As DH and I put it: ""It would be hard to have salmon any other way now!"".  The taste of the cedar radiated throughout the fish. I served it with roasted red potatoes and asparagus.  Wonderful.",2006-01-16

This is the BEST salmon I've had.  So good that we made it two nights later for my in-laws, who also raved.  We didn't have the peppercorns, so we modified seasonings a bit, but the strength of the recipe is in the way it's cooked.  LOVE IT.

So I re-cooked the concoction in the microwave in small batches for about 3 minutes more and poured on my buttered sheet pan and then it cooled to a nice crunchy brittle. SO - a few points to consider, microwaves cook at different speeds and temps. I would highly recommend using a candy thermometer with this recipe because it needs to get to the hard crack stage. The mixture should be lightly browned, frothy and bubbly and it should sizzle a bit when poured on the cookie sheet. That's how you'll know it's been cooked enough. This makes a wonderful, delicious, tasty and crunchy brittle. As long as you make sure to cook it enough - you'll be so happy with the results!",2003-01-02

I added some freshly grated parmesan for a garnish.

The meat needs to be browned in some oil, otherwise it will stick terribly to your pot.  The recipe as it stands is VERY tomatoey, and acidy.  The barley was also too chewy on the times given, and the soup was too thick.  We ended up diluting it out with a couple cups of bouillon broth, and added some sugar, and it was very good at that point.

I prepared it a bit different, I put the spices (included garlic powder) directly onto the cube steaks, flipped them over and repeated.

338193,1173096,3,0,"I made this last night and, unforunately, did not care for it.  The taste was fine, but the texture and technique were lacking.  First, there is too much cornbread for this small amount of chili.  The bread overwhelms the chili.  Second, the cornbread batter has no shortening or oil in it, so it cooked up much heavier and denser than cornbread usually is.  Third, the bottom cornread layer ended up very leaden in comparison to the top layer, which cooked normally.  If I were to try this again, I would use my regular cornbread recipe, make a half-batch, and spread it over the top of the chili, skipping the bottom layer altogether.",2009-12-13

256400,387912,4,1,"I wish I could give a separate rating for taste and for preparation.  Definitely a 5+ for taste, but maybe a 3 for prep.  I've never made lemon bars before, so maybe that was my problem.  I wasn't sure if the butter should be melted or softened.  I softened it and it made sort of a sticky, pasty mess which was VERY difficult to spread in the pan.  Be sure to spray the sides of the pan as well as the bottom.  The crust stuck to the sides of the pan and ripped off the bars when I removed them (and the crust is the best part IMHO!).  Very important - cut the bars IMMEDIATELY upon removing from the oven - cut them even before you sprinkle with powdered sugar.  The top formed a layer before I had finished putting on the powdered sugar, and it made the bars VERY messy to cut.  They basically tore apart.  Bottom line.... the bars taste WONDERFUL... they just don't look very wonderful!  I think I'll try the recipe again though with the changes I mentioned above.  :)",2009-06-12
256400,268616,5,1,"Very yummy! I followed the directions as written and did not find them hard to make, the crust reminded me of pie crust and I may try it in the food processor next time (and there will be a next time). The parchment paper sling really helped to cut the bars while they were still hot (then I just slung them back in the pan after they were cut but more carefully as I had cut some of the parchment paper, too). I cut them into 32 bars and it was a good size for us. Definitely going in my keeper book.",2011-05-04

I used 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar blend (because you are supposed to use it at half strength), 1/2 cup sucanat (unrefined cane sugar), and 1/4 cup prune puree instead of the margarine.

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken to make it vegetarian - next time I would use a mushroom broth. I also didn't have dried parsley or sage (fresh parsley would be nice though) so added a bit of basil and a bit of thyme, worked for me. 
After the 'cook' cycle was over, I stirred in the cheese, but it was still quite liquid. Leaving it to sit on warm for about 8 minutes allowed the rice to finish absorbing the moisture. This might have been excess moisture from the fresh mushrooms (YMMV).

Maybe I should have seen the problem before I tagged it: it's not really possible to use uncooked plum/cherry tomatoes in a pie without it shedding a lot of liquid, which, used with a puff pastry crust is a small disaster! So, although the tastes put together here are great, it was very hard to turn out (I put baking paper at the bottom of a tart dish to prevent any sticking -- I do not have a round skillet which is hob-to-oven-to-table, like this recipe uses). The lots of liquid from the tomatoes made the crust soggy around the edges, and within a while after turning out it also affected the rest of the crust.",2010-07-03

I did the same with this recipe and they turned out wonderfully. I baked half of the batch immediately and rolled the remainder into 1-inch balls and put them in the refrigerator in a reclosable bag.

73166,124557,5,1,"I'm forever in your debt, this is wonderful!, i made it last night, everyone loved it, some of the ingredients sounded really weird, like adding coffee and cocoa powder and beer, but it all came together really well. Thanks! ^-^ ",2004-02-03
73166,120109,5,1,"Best chili I have ever tasted or made. I made a few changes - only 2 cans of kidney beans and doubled the ground beef, used nonalcoholic O'douls beer and used green peppers not chilis. Without a doubt the best chili recipe ever. Thanks!!!",2004-02-11
73166,126009,5,1,"Thanks Amanda!  I just won a chili cook-off at our company using this recipe!  Even more impressive: we're in TEXAS!

Alterations:  I doubled everything to start, except the chilis, so it would be a bit milder.
For the dark beer, I used Guiness Draft.  For the sirloin, I used a couple of thick t-bone steaks, well trimmed and diced into 1/4 to 1/2 inch cubes.  For the ground beef, I used ground sirloin - when I browned the sirloin, I did not ""powder"" it, instead leaving most of the chunks about 1/2"" or larger.

Most Important:  After the initial cooking of the chili in a large stew pot, I transferred it to a couple of crock-pots and left it on low for about 14 hours, stiring only once every couple of hours.

This resulted in a hearty chili that warms you to the bone and has several stages and layers to the flavor that the audience found most interesting and enjoyable.

Thanks again!

I added the meat mixture to the crockpot, where I added all other ingredients.  I left out the beer, sirloin, and oil, and this came out great!  Served it with Chili Corn Muffins  #191 - Yummy!

Also used chili powder instead of chili sauce, and would like to point out that this is definitely a ""know thy chili ingredient"" recipe: my chili powder is so hot that had I used 3 1/2 tablespoons of that *plus* the four chili peppers, I would have had a pot of absolutely lethal chili - and I love my dishes fiery! :-) So, I used the specified amount of chili powder and added one green chili pepper, and got the perfect hot chili.

I gave some of this to a friend of mine that is a gormet chef and he loved it. If you like it hotter, add a variety of hot peppers. I like to add 3 to 4 different kinds depending on what the local store has at the time. Definately a recipe to try at least once.",2005-12-15

73166,153122,5,1,The ingredients in this recipe were somewhat surprising at first but when I thought about them the merging of certain flavors and depths made sense.  My boss and I made this yesterday in our restaurant for all of our employees that braved the weather and came to work.  We had to modify a few things since we are an italian restaurant and don't carry many of those seasonings.  However we did have a creole seasoning on hand used as an ingredient in one recipe so we used that to add the spices needed.  We used a mixture of Guiness and Moretti (an Italian Beer) for the beer requirements and regular green peppers since we had no chili peppers.  We also tripled the recipe to make enough for an entire restaurant staff.  Many eyebrows were raised over some mentioned ingredients until they tasted it....then no one could stop talking about how good it was and many bowls were refilled.  This was quite good and I would do it again for a large gathering.,2006-02-13
73166,40035,5,1,Thumbs up for this recipe! Adjust brown sugar and kidney beans according to your liking.,2006-02-17
73166,280271,5,1,Awsomely Good!! All those different flavors dancing around in your month was wonderful. I took leftovers to work and had some of the girls taste it. No one could figure out what was in it. It was rated 5 stars there also.,2006-02-18
73166,37779,5,1,"My husband and I enjoyed this chili very much. It is quite different from our standard chili. The flavor had a delicate sweetness in addition to the spiced flavor.

I never thought I would resort to a recipe for chili, but was always intrigued by the recipes that called for coffee and cocoa.  (I don't even like coffee!)  This has been in the crock pot for 4 hours and what an explosion of flavors.  I added jalepeno and hot hungarian peppers from my garden instead of the chili's.  3 medium tomatoes from the garden instead of canned, and 2 cans of chili beans and 1 can of pintos.  I almost cut back on the sugar, but I'm glad I didn't - sweet and hot is what I made.   Yum-O!  How versatile and a total keeper.

Thanx!",2006-10-04

I like the concept of the recipe, I just thought maybe it was too tomatoey (if that is a word) for me, even after leaving out 1/2 of one of the tomato paste cans.  I only added 3 cans of the kidney beans, seems like four would have been way too much.  ",2006-10-18

I used Michelob lager (that's what fiance came home with) and only 3 cans of kidney beans.  The consistency is perfect, not too thick or thin.  I used a half can of Rotel tomatoes and 20 ounces of homegrown canned tomatoes my dad gave me. Also, didn't have coriander or oregano, so I used an italian spice blend, (just a little!)and I didn't add any red peppers because of the Rotel addition.  It looks and smells delicious and was interesting to make! Thanks a bunch.",2006-10-29

I made it just as it is written.  Thanks for a great chili recipe!  For those of you worried about the sweetness-don't be! Some people I served said they liked it but could not say what was different and after I told them they only then realized it was the sweet taste.  I might consider using a little stronger pepper next time.,2006-11-02

My changes: increased amount of cubed beef, 1/2 the beer and the brown sugar, and beans (I used little red beans instead of kidney). Used can of chopped tomatoes with chilis, and only one chili pepper. Oh yeah, used decaf coffee as safety precaution for sensitive guests (made a Tiramisu once that kept the neighborhood up all night). The chili had a nice bite, but not overwhelming.  Flavors were deep, smokey and complex. Thinking of pre-mixing a batch of the dry flavorings to keep on hand for future batches! Thanks for a great recipe! ",2006-11-11

I use lots of garlic so I put alot more than 3 cloves maybe 7 cloves. I also could not find in the store chili sauce so I used chili powder. I also used only 3 cans of kidney beans instead of the 4 for this recipe.  

My kids do not like spicy foods so I held off on the chili peppers.  Although, my husband and I love spice so we added chopped jalepenos on top of our chili with a bit of sour cream and shredded cheddar.

Therefore the potential of this recipe with it's odd mix of beer, coffee, cocoa, herbs and spices really did work! I did two things differently: I only used ground beef because meat is very expensive here in NL and I wanted to test the general taste of the recipe  before committing myself to two lots of meat in it, and I lessened the sugar a little (I don't think that effected the total result any) Please see my rating system: 5 stars for a recipe that was easy to make, has a unusual but tasty set of ingredients that I can't wait to experiment with within a smaller serving size to get just perfect for us!

When it was time to eat they were hesitant but good sports and wouldn't you know, every one of them went back for seconds!!

I thought this recipe sounded interesting with beer, coffee and cocoaâ€¦ but the brown sugar really spoiled it for us.  I had to add vinegar, extra chili powder and garlic to make it eatable to balance out the sweetness.

I also cut to two cans of beans. 2) it did not say if it should cook covered or uncovered. I covered it, but let the lid off for the last 30 min. If you like it thicker, the lid off is good. if you like a soupier chili, leave it on. 3) I'm new to cooking and I was not sure what chili peppers were. I did some research and found that any hot peppers will do. I threw in three Serrano peppers. they added a lot of heat. 4) I could not find Cayenne, so I subbed ground red pepper and chili powder blend. 

Great stuff, thanks!",2007-11-03
73166,290614,5,1,"Oh where has this recipe been all my life? I made this chili tonight and have discovered that I have lived with out it for far too long... It is absolutely to die for!!!

In reading the reviews, I decided to add the brown sugar slowly, one TBS at a time tasting as I went along. This recipe is definitely flexible and the world will not come to an end if you omit it all together. Intrigued by the complexity of flavors as I went along, I continued to add the brown sugar to taste and my measurements came close to the amount in the recipe. 

Because it is chili and it is fun to play...

My adjustments were as follows:
*2 Tsp bacon fat instead of oil
*Good quality beef
*Guinness
*Starbucks Coffee
*3 Tsp Chipotle in Adobo sauce instead of the chili sauce
*Good Cocoa Powder
*Ground my own spices
*Used 4 different fresh (seeded)chili peppers

As with all things, your sum will only be as good as your parts. Use the best and freshest ingredients you can get your hands on and they will speak for themselves.

This chili is definitely an award winner in my home!

73166,124416,5,1,"VERY CLOSE to the very best chili.  I used ground buffalo and 1-1/2 lb. buffalo sirloin.  Left out the brown sugar, added 2-3 tablespoons of chili powder.  Used drained and rinsed white, black and dark red kidney beans. Spill in a little of that red wine you're sipping.  Comes out great.  We liked it!  And as usual with chili, it was better the second day.  Great for non-cooking football Sundays.  Serve with grated Cheddar and maybe sour cream if you're so inclined, and we are.  Another contender for the very best chili is #50732, Kelly's chili.  Quite different from this one, but definitely very good.  Many thanks for sharing the recipe.

73166,485329,4,1,"Very good chili.  Not too spicy (I didn't include the chopped chili peppers).  This was very aromatic and the coffee and beer came through slightly.  Some ginger might have even been a nice addition to this.  I'll make it again.  I put the beef sirloin cubes through the food processor so they were not chunks but also were not as fine as ground beef, it was a nice consistancy.",2007-11-26
73166,229850,4,1,"This was good. Very different from the Wendy's chili I usually make. The coffee, beer and cocoa give it a distictively different taste.",2007-11-29
73166,439066,5,1,"GREAT chili! I actually used all ground buffalo instead of the beef and the cubed sirloin. Also, I only had 1 can of beans, but the chili wasn't missing anything! Usually I have to add extra seasoning, but this was right on. I'm excited to have the leftovers!",2007-12-08
73166,760366,5,1,"Fantastic Chili! I advise against using 99%  fat free ground turkey, but it still tastes great with it. 

For the beer I recommend Young's Double Chocolate stout and for the coffee buy a Grande Starbucks drip with an Add Shot of Espresso (drink the rest). For the sirloin, I did a 15 min. marinade of worchester, cumin, and a dash of olive oil. I also added 1.5 teaspoons of minced shallot while browning the steak. 

Next time I'll be using a mix of Sirloin and Filet...",2008-02-19
73166,464185,5,1,"I made this for my husband for lunch. I put it all in the crockpot to make it easier. It smelled wonderfully. I didn't have beer because we don't drink beer, but I used root beer instead. I didn't have chili sauce, so I used chili powder. I didn't have beef sirloin, so just used ground beef. We don't like it too hot, so I skipped the chili peppers. I used white beans instead of kidney and only 1 can as we like chili without beans. I added 1/2 cup taco sauce for a zing. I doubled the tomatoes for extra veggies. I didn't have beef broth, so I used 3 beef bouillon cubes. My husband's only suggestion was that it should be topped with crushed saltines and cheddar cheese. We Love it!!",2007-12-17
73166,215829,5,1,"Very aptly named.  I was not sure if the beans and tomatoes were supposed to be drained or not so I just dumped them in - juice and all.  Also was not sure what type of chili peppers you were referring to - I chopped up Hatch chilis from a can.  The flavor is awesome.  It turned out wonderfully.  Nice little glow with just a touch of sweetness.

Congrats on a great recipe!",2007-12-23
73166,222477,4,1,"We loved this! Because there seemed to be sooo much liquid, I only used one can of tomatoes. I also doubled the cocoa and chili sauce as we love that unusual combo. We ate some for dinner and froze the rest to enjoy later. Thank you!",2008-01-06

73166,397723,5,1,"Yes! Yes! Yes! And guess what? I made this chili vegetarian! Since I turned veggie two years ago, I haven't made myself a good bowl of chili, and I used to make it often.  All I had to do was sub faux ground meat, and vegetable broth instead of the beef. The beer, coffee, and cocoa powder intrigued me, and it was just awesome! Instead of 4 cans kidney beans, I used just 2 along with 1 can black beans and 1 can of corn. Oh, and a little extra beer, hehe.",2008-01-19

73166,34122,5,1,"Since I had leftover sirloin in the fridge, coffee in the coffee pot and beer in the garage I felt compelled to make this chili. I was a bit skeptical that it would be better than my old standby recipe but was I ever wrong!  This chili really is the best I ever tasted! I omitted the coriander because I didn't have any and used a can of Bud instead of dark beer. I used a t. of chili powder in place of the peppers. I also only had one can of beans so this ended up heavy on the meat.  Next time I will use less brown sugar because it was a little sweet.  All that aside, this is an amazing chili recipe.  Can't wait to make it again just as written.",2008-01-22

73166,39311,5,1,You are right.  This is the best chili we've ever had.  I've been looking for a good chili recipe for years and have finally found it.  I made it exactly as called for and I would not change one thing.  It is perfect just as it is.  I will be making this often.,2008-01-27
73166,750529,5,1,"Amazing recipe!  I cut the sugar in half, only used one chili pepper, and added a tablespoon of chili powder.  I also used 1 lb of cubed beef sirloin in addition to the 1 lb of ground beef.  I used Bass ale as my beer (20 oz. can).  I am not a huge fan of most chilis, but this was really, really great.  I'll be making this often!",2008-02-02
73166,256795,4,1,This was a very good chili.  I left out the kidney beans (DH allergic) and the peppers (didn't have any).  The flavor of this is sweet with some zing.  It is very rich!!  I served this with cheese & some yummy cornbread.  Thanks for sharing!!  :O),2008-02-12
73166,233417,2,0,This wasn't a hit for us but I have to share that I didn't add the peppers and I think omitting them threw off the balance of sweet and spicy that everyone else who reviewed this seemed to love.  I will keep on looking!,2008-02-15
73166,601528,5,1,Full of flavor but not spice which  is EXACTLY what I was lookin for.  Everyone in my family raved and raved about this.  I used ground beef only to cut down on cost and did not add the peppers for fear they would add heat that I did not want.  My seven year old who would rather have chili from the can than anything homemade loved this recipe.  Thanks so much!,2008-02-22
73166,169166,5,1,"This was super delish and really fun to make. A bit pricey too, but worth it! I omitted the hot peppers and mashed the kidney beans before adding them to the pot cuz I'm not a big fan of beans. This also works to hide them from kids who don't like them! I froze alot and keep enjoying it occasionally. I eat served with Frito scoops, and sometimes sour cream and old chedder shreds. Thanks so much, it's a keeper!",2008-02-24

73166,783779,2,0,"I doubled the recipe but used the 1/2 C. brown sugar as recommended  in original recipe. It was way too sweet still. If I make this again, I'll only use 2 T. brown sugar in a doubled recipe.",2008-03-07
73166,389431,4,1,"This was good! 
I didn't use the cubed beef, just substituted more ground beef and I didn't use all of the brown sugar (only about 1/4 C). After letting it cook, we decided that it needed a bit more bean (we like our beans around here!), so we added 2 cans of pintos to the pot. 
It was tasty... 
It wasn't the best chili I've ever had (that title belongs to my Papa... his chili is to die for!), but it was good and filling on a cold day!
Thanks so much!",2008-03-10

Whether poured over hot pasta, mixed with crumbled corn bread or eaten by itself this one is a winner.  I ate it 4 days staight and was quite happy.  I even made my wife a steak and potatoes one night and was very satisfied to eat a bowl of this instead.  The only change I might make is that next time I might (and I do mean might) cut back a little on the beans.  Easy, good, winner!!",2008-03-11
73166,185926,5,1,Good combination of ingredients.  I used two cans of beans because my crockpot was full.  The taste has lots of depths and layers without being too spicy.

I used local stuff when possible (Yebisu Black beer, Asahi Wonda Black coffee, and Japanese ground beef/pork mixed). I mixed four kinds of beans (Great Northern, black, red, Pinto). I couldn't find coriander, and had to use an odd soy-based chili sauce, but upped the amount of chili peppers to make up for it. ^.^ The beer and chocolate came through nicely and this incredibly tasty stuff.

Was a little afraid of the sweetness, so I just used 1 Tbsp of Splenda brown, and I won't increase it next time, for our palates, it was perfect. DH isn't big on super spicey, so I just added 1 Serrano Chili and that was hot enough for him! Overall, a real winner. Certainly our new Chili recipe! Can't wait to have it again tonight!",2008-07-28

We added a bit of extra molasses in addition to the brown sugar (shhh... my grandpa would rise up from the grave if he knew I gave up his secret chili ingredient!!!!).  We also toned down the Chili Sauce a bit and used mild chilies as we like to taste our chili not just feel the burn. Turned out awesome... almost as good as my grandpa's... ALMOST!!!!,2008-09-01
73166,46660,4,1,"I am surprised I didn't like this better with all the rave reviews. I just found it to be almost sickeningly sweet. I didn't have time to read all the reviews or I probably would have seen that most people leave the chili sauce and brown sugar out and replace it with chili powder. I will be sure to make note and try it again that way, because the texture of it was perfect, so definitely worth working with until I find alterations that suit my tastes better.",2008-09-18

73166,252084,4,1,"Yummy chili, here.  My tips:
-- NO more than 2Tbl. brown sugar; might even cut it nexy time.
-- 2-3 cans of beans is plenty.  ""Mostly drain"" them (but not the diced tomatoes).
-- Don't skip the diced sirloin; it adds a great texture element alongside the ground beef.
-- Foster's isn't very dark, but very easy to buy one (large) can at a time for you non-beer households! 
-- Definitely store the chili overnight or longer before eating.  We ate our batch several times this week!",2008-10-18

If I were to make it again which I probably won't, I would definitely leave out the brown sugar. My 12 year old said it tasted like and I quote ""candy"". Need I say more.

I also found it was a great way to confuse them...because it was chocolate...but it was dinner.

I used an espresso machine for the coffee and put in a double shot topped up with water ad that was a bit strong.  I am also going to replace the cubed beef with kangaroo but leave the mince as beef and cut down the brown sugar by about a quarter just to see what happens.",2008-10-23

We used espresso coffee, used chili powder (as someone else suggested), used 1/2 the sugar (I have trouble with too much sweet), and used white kidneys & pinto mix.  It wasn't bad really.

73166,404046,5,1,"Wow this was great!  I chose this recipe because I was curious how beer, coffee and chocolate would work in a chili and was floored on how good it came out!  I thought I had a good chili recipe until I made this!  I was worried a few times during the recipe but stayed the course (like when there was so much liquid before it's 1 1/2 hr cooking time), but the sauce reduced as it cooked without a top on it.  I think it helped concentrate all the flavors better while making it thicker.  I was also concerned with the amount of chili sauce it called for.  When I tasted it after adding it, it seemed way too hot.  But the different flavors blended as they cooked, cooling it down some and was perfect the next day.  The only changes I did was: add a 1/4 c of brown sugar instead of 1/2 c; and added chili powder instead of chilis (because I forgot to pick them up at the store).  I also cooked the garlic separately in a different pan with oil (because I was scared to burn it) then added it to the mixture a couple minutes before the tomato, beer, and coffee.  I can see why people have used this recipe and won competitions!  I can't wait to try it again and wow someone with its ingredients and taste!",2008-11-16

73166,136004,5,1,"Fabulous chili!  Made it early a.m. and by supper the flavors were blended enough for our pallette.  Served with grated cheese and a spoon of sour cream and a side of cornbread - doesn't get much better than that on a chilly evening.  Recipe didn't state to drain the liquid from beans so added most of it, but not all.  Used 2 tsp. of chili powder instead of the 4 chili peppers.  Added 2 chopped fresh tomatoes toward the end.  Next time I'll make my own kidney beans instead of using canned, just to experiment.  Thanks for a great recipe!",2008-11-26

73166,667148,5,1,My family and friends loved this chili.  It is great!  The teenage boys all ate two bowls and couldn't seem to get enough.  Use dark beer as the flavor is just great.,2008-12-01

73166,1055345,5,1,Very good just a bit too sweet but easily fixed. Much better on day 2.,2008-12-02
73166,1060424,5,1,"Fantastic- reduced sugar to 1/4 cup, added large can of Bush's beans rather than all those kidney beans, added can of corn, only 2 jalapenos, added lots of cayenne pepper and more cumin, and used fresh tomatoes over the canned. I ended up putting it all into a crockpot with a small beef roast (instead of ground meat and cubed serloin) and let it cook over night (14 hours). This morning i got up to taste it and WOW- the slow cooked meat just falls apart adding a soft delicously flavorable meat to the chili. My crockpot is small and the beer wouldn't fit (i was so excited about adding beer to chili) i guess next time i will reduce the beef broth and scale back on the quantities so that the beer can fit. If you love this recipe be sure to try a Mexican sweet mole. It's a ground nut, honey, and dark chocolate based sauce that is served over meats. Lovely!!",2008-12-06
73166,1015722,5,1,"We've never had chilli before so i was abit dubious when i was making it, but it tasted great and better the next day. Left out the sirloin and the chilli peppers so probably wasnt as spicy as it was supposed to be, but not bad for my first try! lol",2008-12-06

73166,1068926,5,1,"Agree w/ other reviews, this is really a great recipe!  I do not even like chili  normally, but made for a winter party as I like the idea of chili - warm, hearty, make ahead & great with beer.  Served with Cornbread and Salad.  I found myself even liking it!  As instructed this is better after sitting a day in the fridge.  Held back on beans and spice (only put in 1 can of beans + 1/2 of the cayenne & no chili peppers - nice level for the mixed crowd).  Excellent!!",2008-12-11

This time I didn't because it was freezing outside and this recipe appealed to me.  I did not have a dark beer, my husband went to the grocery store and they were just too darn expensive so I used a regular miller lite (most of the can) I also had just recently thrown out my chili sauce so I added about 1 tablespoon of chili powder.  I did not have any coriander so I just did not use it.  Too make this kid friendly I did not add any cayenne or chilli peppers.  I like a spicy chilli but my three kids do not so that is the only reason I did not use the peppers.  With my changes this chilli still came out pretty darn good! And I am from Texas!",2008-12-16

Thank you so much for a unique version of chili.",2009-01-18
73166,1151536,5,1,"The taste intensifies wonderfully after cooling, keep in mind while adjusting to taste for sweetness/spiciness as suggested. Delicious with lettuce, avocados and fresh tomatoes, we don't even feel like adding cheddar cheese, very very tasty!",2009-02-01

I made the chili for Christmas eve for relatives who had been traveling all day. Cooked the day before and reheated for dinner. Excellent. Made more than 8 servings. I had to make several modifications because my family does not eat red meat and I forgot some things at the store: Instead of beef, I subbed Morningstar Farms recipe crumbles (1 1/2 bags), I used chicken broth instead of beef broth, no chili peppers or paste, but I used 2 1/2 Tbls of chili powder, I also cut the brown sugar down to 2 Tbls, and finally, I only used 2 cans of kidney beans and added 1 can of pintos and one can of black beans. The rest of the listed ingredients were used. I was especially excited to use a bottle of Guinness draught in the dish. It was simply delicious. AND, still spicy enough for my sister! It was a big hit with my entire family!",2008-12-27

73166,1131079,5,1,"I am going to enter this chili in my company's chili cookoff tomorrow. I made the recipe exactly as printed, and used the full 1/2 cup brown sugar even though others had said it was too sweet. It IS sweet, which is weird for me because I am used to thick tomato-based texas-style chilis. This is NOT your average chili. It is more soupy since it has a base of beer, beef broth, and coffee. It is not very thick. I hope over night it will thicken up a bit. It is however AMAZING tasting. My hubby and I have shared 2 bowls already. We can't stop eating it but we don't know WHY - is it the beer? The sugar? We aren't sure exactly what it is that makes this chili so good, but it is darn good. In my husband's words it has a very ""complex"" taste that he can't quite put his finger on. Thanks for a great recipe!",2009-01-15
73166,518488,2,0,"Obviously I'm in the minority here, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. This chile tastes more like baked beans with meat in it and although it's nice, I like my chile to taste like chile.  The sweetness was the only drawback for me--it had a nice flavor otherwise & you couldn't even tell there was beer, coffee and chocolate in it. But that might be because of the sweetness! If I ever make it again, which is doubtful, I would omit most or all of the sugar.",2009-01-19
73166,1136908,5,1,"This chili is amazing! Every single person that has tasted this has said it was the best they've ever had. I agree with the previous comment that it was a little sweet (but still outstanding) so I took out the brown sugar on one of my cooks and added 2 jalepeno peppers and 2 habenero peppers both diced to the mix. WOW! After the 2nd step (browning the garlic, onions & meat) I transfered that to my crock pot,  added the rest of the ingredients and let it slow cook in the crock for 4 hours (stirring occasionally) and then shut off the crock and let it stand for about 4 more hours.  This mix is way HOT while cooking (I taste everything occasionally during the cook) but it calms down after the flavors meld together. The BEST chili ever!!!

73166,824052,4,1,This chili was good but I wouldn't say it was the best chili I ever had.  The first day I would have given it 3 stars but the second day after the flavors blended it tasted better.  I used all ground beef as I didn't have any sirloin. I didn't have  chili sauce. I used ketchup and chili powder. I didn't have chili peppers.  Definitely cut brown sugar in half or less. I used 4 tablespoons. I loved the texture of it. It did have complex taste.  Overall good chili. Maybe if I had used the sirloin and chili peppers it would have been 5 stars for me,2009-01-26
73166,412541,5,1,"I was very skeptical, but this really was the best chile I've ever had.  I wasn't sure what kind of chili sauce I was supposed to use, so I used the garlic chili sauce I already had.  I was surprised that there was only one can of tomatoes, but it turned out good;  at first I thought the 2 cans of tomato paste made it too saucy, but I really like it that way.  I may use a little more diced tomatoes and less tomato paste next time, but it really was excellent, with a very complex flavor- whatever you do don't leave out the cocoa or the coriander, they add alot of flavor.  I usually don't care for chili with beer in it either, but again, it was great!",2009-01-26

DH was a little disappointed that he couldn't actually taste the coffee and the beer in the mix, but agreed that it was very good nonetheless. :-) I made mine in the slow cooker. I browned the meat, onions, and garlic and added to the cooker with all of the other ingredients, except for 2 cans of beans. Cooked it for 9 hours on low and added the other 2 cans of beans when I got home from work. Let it cook for about 20 minutes while some corn muffins baked. I will probably add some more peppers next time, as we like our chili of the 5-alarm variety.

I also used two chili peppers and two jalapenos.  The chili last night was very spicy but after sitting in the fridge over night and being reheated today, the spice factor has settled.  The only other change I made was three large cans of kidney beans (I think they were 18 oz. each) rather then the 4, 14 oz cans.

73166,1172296,5,1,"tried this for superbowl with a few changes

i used chipotle peppers exclusively..the canned type...followed the recipe for a bit but i browned the meat in a seperate pan then used the beer to deglaze ( and burn off the booziness).  i strongly advise against lean beef..i used medium ground steak (use beef if you don't wanna spend the money), ground pork and tri-tip beef for some chunkiness.

definately leave out the sugar and go with chili powder as oppsed to sauce...cuts the sweetnes way down and you will get it elsewhere.

start onions and garlic first and allow to sweat....20-30 mins on lowest heat possible...remember when deglazing pan from beef to add all the goodness to the pot.

and i let it simmer for 6 hours tasting and adjusting seasoning every hour or so..

73166,908300,5,1,"To keep the cost down I omitted the beer & used chili powder. I also halved the salt. We had this for dinner the 1st day & thought it was nice but too salty & too spicy. The next day the flavours calmed down & it was really good. I froze the rest.  I was going to give 4 stars but my husband took some to work last night & came home raving about it. He's not raved that much about any of my other frozen meals, hence it's a 5 star & I will be making this again soon!",2009-04-16
73166,1220961,5,1,"I made this chili for our family cook-off and it was a HUGE hit! The beer, cocoa and cumin gave it a unique taste that was anything but bland and/or ordinary. It was by far the best contestant.",2009-04-20
73166,521566,5,1,"This is so DELICIOUS!!! I used ground sirloin and cut up a steak, I did not add salt. I read a bunch of reviews about how good it was the next day, so I made it at night let it cool, refridgerated and we ate it the following day. I can not wait to make this chili for company. My kids loved it & everyone knows how picky kids are. There was nothing to freeze, my family ate it all in 2 days!! THANKS!!",2009-04-22
73166,185365,5,1,What can I say or add?  OUTSTANDING!!!  This is not a chili for chili dogs.  We prefer to scoop it up with Frito's Scoops instead of spoons.  I also use two cans of black beans (added at the end) and two cans of pinto beans.  I also add two chilies in adobe sauce and a small amount of chilpolte chili powder instead of the chili sauce.,2009-04-26
73166,486680,4,1,Really nice.  It was a lot sweeter than we are used to but very nice for a change.  I only put Â½ the cayenne in as our chilli sauce is extremely hot.  It was really rich and lovely.  I made cornbread muffins to serve with it.  Thanks for a lovely recipe.,2009-05-01

73166,1329827,5,1,"I've made this chili about 15 times.  It is awesome and a huge hit at parties -- NEVER any left overs.  

A lot of the reviews think it's too sweet.  That's easy to fix -- use more beef broth, coffee, beer, oregano, and/or cumin to give it an earthier taste, and less brown sugar and chili sauce. Be sure to let the liquid boil off about 1/2 inch to get a more concentrated flavor.  

I substitute extra lean ground turkey for the ground beef and steak to cut out the fat and cholesterol. I also use low sodium beans, broth, and canned tomatoes. If you let the water boil off, you don't miss the extra salt at all.  My southern friends from Georgia were very skeptical of my healthy alterations, but not after they tasted it and ate the whole pot.",2009-07-20
73166,1015482,5,1,Not much to add to all of the other reviews. I've made this three times now and apparently have not reviewed it yet. I skip the sirloin and use more types of beans but otherwise stick pretty closely to the listed ingredients. Delicious.,2009-07-28

It was spectacular.  I cut the brown sugar back to 1/4 cup (and will try it with 2 Tbsp next time) and only had room in the pot for 2 cans of beans.  Otherwise made as directed.  I used Bass Pale Ale for the beer.  Served with Fritos and shredded cheddar cheese.  Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch.  I'll bet it's even better today!,2009-08-22

I only used 2 cans of the beans (i don't like them in chili) i only used 2 chilies fearing the too hot factor and did not use the seeds. although the chili did have a ok taste and a slight ""burn"" at the end the sweetness seemed to get more and more intense eating the bowl of it. we used a guiness beer and my DH got a black coffee from Dunkin Donuts since we don't like coffee, i still could smell the coffee and that turned me off a little. I think this would be a great recipe just need to cut way back on the sugar because you can always add more, but once it is in there you can't get it out.",2009-09-12
73166,1395002,5,1,Just made it and it's cooking on low in the crockpot until our tailgate tomorrow! So far it's awesome!!! Sweet at first then a bit of heat at the end...I only used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 serrano chili/1 habanero chili as opposed to 4 chili peppers.  (I don't like my food too hot and kids are going to eat too.)  My only concern at this early stage is that it is a bit soupy...hopefully it will thicken up overnight.  But the flavor is amazing already!!! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!,2009-10-02

73166,1411609,5,1,"I made this 3 days ago.  I think it's very good, you just can't expect it to be like traditional Chili, but it still tastes like Chili.  I would call it Gourmet Chili.  We all really liked it. 

The directions didn't say whether to drain the beans or the tomatoes, so I drained the kidney beans and used the liquid from the tomatoes.  I used Amber Bock beer because that's what I had.  It's not as heavy as Guiness.  The only actual change I made was to leave out the chili peppers because we had strep throat.  It was still pleasantly spicy the first night.  For me too much spice ruins a dish because I can't taste what's underneath it.  After refrigeration the spicy from just the cayenne pepper mellows into all the flavors with a tiny kick.  This recipe definitely has it's place, just depends on who you are cooking for. It will be my other chili recipe, in no specific order.",2009-10-15

It should mention that you should drain the ground beef. It should also mention whether you should drain the beans or not. Also, is it ground coriander? I brewed 3 cups of coffee, then realized maybe the recipe meant 3 cups as in units of measurement. Also, what kind of chili peppers? I ended up using poblanos and that was a nice choice, but I had to figure out how many chili peppers equals one poblano. And for beginner cooks, it should mention what heat settings you should use on your stove. I tried to simmer it and even though I stirred very often, it still ended up burning.",2009-10-22

I also used 3 different kinds of beans, 1 can of red, 2 cans of kidney and 1 can of pinto. Overall it was really good chili that I would definitely make again only next time I would probably cut the brown sugar back to 1 tablespoon and add more to taste from there.",2009-10-27

As I was storing the leftovers--I hope to heck it made more than 6 servings!!--the aroma is amazing, but the taste was just too sweet. No biggie, 1/4 cup of brown sugar--or demarara sugar, but not dark brown...I used two whole seeded habaneros, one minced up, the other just chucked in sliced open; in addition to the 2 serranos halved and seeded and the Anaheim chili. Personally, I could have used 3 habs. I didn't realize what a pepperhead I've become! I used 3T chili powder, not being sure what Amanda meant by chili sauce. My stepson came up with the plan of dumping it over the potatoes I baked in the Weber. I went back for seconds, then another shot at the pan full I pulled before I added the chilis, for my DW who doesn't do hot. I think half the brown sugar, a bit less cocoa will do it. Chunks of sirloin were amazing!! burp.",2009-10-29

I cooked mine in the crock pot (browned meat, onions and garlic in a sauce pan first)  for about 2 hours instead of on top of the stove. Very good, highly recommended.",2010-03-29
73166,982333,4,1,"This was a good recipe, but I wouldn't go as far as the best chili I have ever tasted. I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup and I'm glad I did. It would have definitely been too sweet otherwise. I was unsure if the beans or tomatoes were supposed to be drained as the directions didn't indicate it. So I drained the beans, but kept the juice the tomatoes were in. The chili is not as thick as I like it, but I think that is my fault since I cooked it in the crockpot instead of stovetop. More liquid evaporates off and condenses when you do it on the stove top. I probably would have given it a 5 if the directions had been clearer and not called for so much sugar to make it too sweet. Obviously, taste is subjective. It is definitely a good recipe to start with. I'll probably make it again, tweaking it a bit more. Thanks for the recipe!",2009-11-01

73166,337952,5,1,"The fun thing about chili is being able to play with it.  I was looking for a base recipe for the crockpot and all the good reviews led me straight to this one.  As with most of the other chefs, I subbed.  I used a mix of ground beef, pork, chicken and hot italian sausages, grated dark chocolate, black and pinto beans, and serrano and chili peppers.  Omitted all but a tablespoon or so of sugar and used chili powder, but the uniqueness of the coffee and dark beer was amazing.  I almost didn't want to add the spices, just that with the cooked meats and onions was SO good.  So, if this help another person sub item they don't have or don't like, great!

73166,772128,1,0,I made this as per recipe without changing anything. I didn't care for it at all. The cocoa was really over powering and just didn't taste right in chili.,2009-11-27
73166,634575,5,1,"I made this for a football party this weekend, & it was a pretty big hit. I had my doubts at first. I didn't have all the ingredients including the dark beer. I started making this about 12 hrs in advance of the big day & let if cook on low until serving - I recommend doing this if you can. For the first 10 hours, I was in a total panic b/c it was WAY TOO SWEET. Check out my name, I like sweet, but this was way too much for even me. The next day, 2 hrs before game time, i sent my friend to the store for a beer to add. Let me say this, BEER IS THE KEY INGREDIENT. She brought me an Amber Bock or Rock or something like that. I knew I didn't like Guiness - be careful which kind you get. Guiness is very strong and thick so ask a beer drinker or clerk first if you don't want to sample it yourself. I nearly wept with relief when I tasted it after adding the beer. It was completely cured of the sugar overload and tasted very yummy. I will make this again, but only if I have all the ingredients. Amanda thanks for sharing your prize winning recipe. It's a keeper, & I'll say it again, follow the ingredient list - Beer makes it better.  UPDATE:  Made this again and followed the recipe to the letter.  VERY GOOD - don't mess with the ingredient list until you've tried it out as written.  I thought the Cayenne pepper would make it too hot, but it cooked down to create a complex subtle flavoring - just a hint of heat.  Very good!!!!  Thanks again Amanda.  You ROCK!!!",2009-11-29

I agree with the other reviewers regarding the recipe being a little unclear.  I used 13 1/2 oz for the can on beef broth, and a 12 oz can for beer.  As a previous reviewer suggested, the beer is a key ingredient - it can change the flavor significantly, so use a beer that you enjoy.  I did find that it was more ""soupy"" than I had hoped for - though I am not sure if it was because I made X2.5 on the recipe, or because the recipe was not specific as to sizes as can sizes are not universal.  Next time I make it, I will drain and rinse the beans, cut back a bit on the beef broth, and cook it in a crock pot on low for many an hour.  It was an amazing chili though and it will be my ""go to"" recipe.  Thanks Amanda.",2009-12-04

73166,1283585,4,1,"Pretty good when made in a crock pot. As an inexperienced cook I was a little frustrated that the recipe didn't specify whether to drain the beef and beans. Also, I used coriander seed since it didn't specify and I was unfamiliar with the spice, but ground coriander would probably work much better. I omitted diced tomatoes and onions because of picky eaters in my family and used only ground beef and 3 cans of kidney beans. Added a little tomato sauce and some chili powder as well. The recipe came out too sweet even with only 1/3 cup sugar. I found a cooking forum that suggested adding dry mustard to taste to balance it, and that worked pretty well. Overall a good recipe, but next time I'll use extra caution adding sweet ingredients and omit the coriander completely.",2010-01-18
73166,937635,5,1,"Fantastic chili! I've been trying to find a chili recipe I can use as a go-to and didn't have any luck until I found this one. This is a great chili with a wonderful semi-sweet and savory taste. I used 1.5lbs of ground beef and about a pound of beef stew meat and added an extra clove or garlic. I didn't have any chili peppers, so I subbed 2 teaspoons of chili powder as others suggested. I only used 1/2 tsp cayenne because I have a little one who loves beans, and the chili was perfectly spicy for us. I think 4 cans of kidney beans are perfect and give it that healthy boost of fiber (not to mention, my 15 month old Loves them!). Thanks!",2010-01-18

I also added 3 tbsp of hot sauce..they LOVE everything spicey at my house. Thanks for a great recipe!!,2010-01-18

The taste was differant from what we usually expect from chile but very nice.  DH felt it was a little too sweet (I liked it) so would probably leave out the brown sugar next time.  By the way, the directions didn't mention when to add the sugar - so I just added it with the spices.  We served with recipe#410289 but think next time I'd use a simple corn bread recipe.

For the contest I also added lots more garlic, Guninness, maple bacon, maple syrup (but cut the sugar to 1/3), tabasco, double cayenne and fresh cilantro just before serving.

I followed the directions exactly but should have taken note of the reviews about sweetness.  I did find it to be too sweet for chili and will cut the brown sugar AT LEAST in half the next time I prepare this.  I also added 1/2 cup of red wine and drained the liquid from 2 cans of beans to compensate.  I used canned green chilis and added about 1 T. of my favorite hot sauce as well.  I think the next time I make this, I will switch up the beans a bit and add 1 can of light kidney beans, 1 can of dark, 1 can of pinto beans and 1 can of black beans.  The color diversity will go well with the diversity of tastes and textures!

Not sure where this is coming from, but most likely:  (1) Chili Seasoning - usually 1/4 salt.  Better to make your own and leave the salt out or cut way back.  (2) Beef Broth - lower salt varieties are available that cut the salt 50%   (3) Canned foods used - beans, tomato paste, etc.<br/><br/>It is not difficult to reduce salt, and then the 1/4 teaspoon added during cooking can carry the flavor.<br/><br/>I also agree with - too much sugar, too much reliance on beer, coffee for flavor.

The only thing I may add next time is some chopped jalapenos to kick up the heat. We loved the recipe and will definitely be making it again soon!",2010-10-06

I loved the beer and cocoa since I do use that in other recipes, but I am not sure what didn't work.  But WAY WAY too sweet, just not like chili should be. The sirloin was nice but there just was a lot missing for me and the sweet just took over. I saw this a few weeks ago and printed it out and was taking it to a friend today.  I actually threw the entire pot out and started over. For me it was nothing I wanted to eat. My friend tasted it and felt the same way.  I'm sorry. Just didn't think it was good.",2010-10-07

We aren't alcohol drinkers, so the added $3 for a dark beer that was not on hand and out of the way for us.  The color was darker than our usual chili, mostly due to the cocoa, coffee and dark beer.  We browned up the beef and veggies before slow cooking the rest overnight on low.  The recipe did not mention whether or not to drain the ground beef, we did.  It also didn't mention to drain and rinse the beans, we did.  It smelled great, even though it was a strong beer type of smell.  We did not add all the sugar, but half of it based on other reviews.  We tried this recipe as it caught our eye in the weekly email sent out.  We most likely won't be making it again, although we will be eating it a few more times.",2010-10-08

For starters, I use chuck instead of sirloin for superior beefy flavor.  I also do not use any of the sugar.  I also add 1 tsp of hickory flavored liquid smoke.  Here's the whole ingredients list:<br/><br/>2 onions, chopped<br/><br/>10 or more cloves garlic, minced<br/><br/>2-3  lbs ground beef<br/><br/>2-3  lbs chuck steak, cut into small cubes, most of the fat removed.<br/><br/>2 (14 1/2 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes<br/><br/>1 cup strong coffee or a couple of teaspoons of instant espresso<br/><br/>2 (12 ounce) cans tomato paste<br/><br/>1 can beef broth (or 1 TBsp of ""better than broth"" beef base and 12 oz of water)<br/><br/>3 1/2 tablespoons Heinz chili sauce (about 1/2 of a regular-sized bottle)<br/><br/>1 tablespoon ground cumin<br/><br/>2 tablespoons cocoa powder<br/><br/>1 tablespoon dried oregano leaves<br/><br/>1 tablespoon ground cayenne<br/><br/>1 tablespoon ground coriander<br/><br/>1 tablespoon onion powder<br/><br/>1 - 2 tablespoons crushed red pepper<br/><br/>1 tablespoon salt  (or to taste)<br/><br/>1 teaspoon hickory flavor liquid smoke<br/><br/>6 - 8 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, black beans, pinto beans etc - make it as beany as you want - don't drain them unless the chili is already too runny",2010-11-05

Thanks for a fun new chili recipe!,2010-11-06
73166,745868,5,1,"Amanda, I think your chili is wonderful.  It is definitely a different flavor, but that doesn't make it bad, it makes it unique!  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  I didn't find it too sweet, I felt the brown sugar offset the tomatoes and probably the bitterness of the cocoa. A nice warmth in the back of the throat, but not so hot to make your eyes water or nose run.   I think if I were blind-folded and tasted this, I would definitely identify it as chili.  A great recipe I will be making again!",2010-11-07

My only frustration wish the recipe was it just said chili peppers, and this was enough to confuse me hah.  So, it was decided on serranos.  Wash your hands very good after cutting these things up.  Or just wear led gloves.  Maybe because of how hot these were, it didn't seem to sweet to me at all!",2010-11-07

73166,1357028,5,1,"Seriously the best chili I've ever had or made.  I also cut down the brown sugar to 2 TB - may just do 1 TB next time.  But I found the sweet a good compliment to the heat.  I was really drawn to this recipe because of it's lack of chili powder - which ruins chili in my opinion.  I didn't use the sirlon & switched out two cans of pinto beans for the (light) kidney beans.  It was AWESOME!  I only used 1 serrano pepper & 1 jalepeno & it was super hot - & I can take some heat.  I also simmered it for several hours and on day 2, LOOK OUT, it's even better!  My 5 yr old who ""hates"" chili ate this like a champ after seeing how good we thought it was.

73166,1710552,4,1,"The BEST is a tall claim but it's really good..better than I thought it would be!  I too doubted it could be good without chili powder, and doubted the use of sugar in the recipe.  It turns out that if you use cocoa powder, the sugar is a must to avoid a tinny bitter taste  of unsweetened cocoa.  The cocoa & cumin adds richness and the sugar rounds it out.  Changes I made:<br/>- espresso instant coffee powder (1 tbs) rather than 1 cup of brewed coffee. The amount of liquid was perfect as a result.  Tastes great with corn bread, plain corn tortilla chips, and even better when reheated the next day (like most pot style recipes).<br/>- I used only 2 red hot chili peppers and it was plenty of heat!  3 would have been overkill.  If you don't like hot food, I may even recommend 1 chili. I'm the type of person that adds heat to most things I eat.<br/>- I made it with just a tablespoon of sugar at first, but it wasn't enough. Husband and I agree that there was a tinny, vinegar, bitter taste.  3 tbs total of sugar fixed the problem.<br/>- 2 cans of kidney beans rather than 4.  Perfect balance of meat - sauce - beans.<br/><br/>I usually make a TX style chili too, which does have a smokier, more spiced flavor, but that recipe requires vegetable shortening.  I like this recipe as a healthier version without compromising taste.",2011-01-08

73166,931148,4,1,This is a very good recipe. I too much like a lot of other people cut the amount of sugar and only added 2 Tbsp. I also only used ground beef and not 1/2 ground 1/2 sirloin chunks. The only chili sauce I had on hand was Thai hot / sweet sauce so that's what i used.

I think I may use a little less sugar, but I don't really measure, so I'm not sure.<br/>I do only use two cans of beans (one kidney, one pinto), since my DH prefers no beans, and I like beans. I usually leave out the peppers so that my 5yo will eat it, but I use diced tomatoes with chipotle peppers, so there is a little heat.

73166,183634,1,0,"Sorry, but this recipe just didn't cut it. It didn't taste ANYTHING like what Chili is supposed to taste like. I was so looking forward to it after reading all the rave reviews, but was SO disappointed. It was too sweet, no smokey flavor, too much beer flavor (UGH!) too much coffee. I could go on with the problems, but you get the picture. I followed the recipe to a ""T""  so this rating is based strictly on this recipe as is posted.  *The excess beer taste was the worst part of this dish*",2011-10-21

We heated it in a crock pot after we browned everything and used both light and dark kidney beans, along with black beans and some white beans too.  We added some different kinds of peppers also, and we found if you add some later, they stay crunchy.  Our absolute favorite that guests and family always ask about!  Thank you - love, love, LOVE!",2011-10-23

73166,2046360,5,1,"The beauty of chili is that it can have a ton of different flavors, including sweet, spicy, smoky, meaty, etc.  A lot of people are knocking this chili because it's ""too sweet.""  As with all foods, if you come into it expecting it to taste like YOU think it should taste, then you will be disappointed.  Another beauty of chili is that you can throw just about anything in it.  I've used this recipe about 4 times (every time I've made chili) and modified it in different ways every time.  EVERY time I've made it it has been for a competition, and I've either won or placed in the top 3 every time.  Beer is great because it adds a great flavor (and the alcohol either burns out or is negligible for those parents out there).  I've started adding bacon and mixing up the beans, putting about a third each of chili beans, pinto beans, and black beans.  I also substitute Ro-Tel instead of tomatoes and chilis.  I don't really recall what the recipe calls for, but I always try to balance the sweet and not-so-sweet flavors.  Also, chili powder is not what gives good chili that flavor. Cumin, however, I have found adds a really good flavor.  I feel like I can never put too much cumin in my chili.  Great chili!",2011-10-28
73166,898747,5,1,"Love this chili. I omit the brown sugar, because I find it just a bit too sweet for my taste. I add a sprinkle of cinnamon and little chipotle pepper because I like the depth of flavor this provides. I have tried it many ways and I think the dark beer is very important again for a big deep flavor. I disagree with the last reviewer, chili is open for interpretation just like all other American classics. I think this one is worth a try!",2011-11-15

Even with the sweet taste, this still was the best chili I have ever tasted! I made it for a New Year's Eve party and everyone loved it and quite a few people wanted the recipe. Yes, it was sweet, but it was also very spicy - and so for me, it definitely ""worked"" - delicious!! Would definitely recommend it - with the watch-the-sugar warning - and will DEFINITELY make again - so I am standing by my five-star review (and in fact just finished off the leftovers a few minutes ago!!)",2012-01-02
73166,850974,4,1,"This was definitely a good guide for me to make a really delicious chili! Probably the best one I've ever made, but I did make a number of changes to the recipe. I doubled the garlic, and used 1 pound of spicy chorizo instead of lean ground beef. For the beer I used a dark porter which I would definitely recommend!! After that, I omitted the brown sugar and chili sauce and used about 2 tablespoons of maple syrup to add just a little bit of sweetness to the chili and to take the edge off all the heat! Broth was better than bouillon veggie base and water. About the heat... I used 2 red jalapenos and one poblano for freshness and flavor. I kept all the spices the same as listed in the recipe, but added an orange bell pepper to the mix. This made the spicy factor perfect for me (spicy but no burning), and if people wanted more heat they could add chili sauce (sriracha) to their own bowls. I didn't buy kidney beans at the store because I thought I had some... so I used the only beans I had which was 1 can of red beans and 3 cans of black beans. It came out DELICIOUS. The chunks of beef are a nice touch. Served with fat free greek yogurt, cheddar cheese, green onions, and freshly baked homemade cornbread! YUM",2012-01-15

I made a big dish of corn bread w/cheddar and jalape?os to go with it.  It wasn't too sweet as many describe, and the coffee and beer where clear enhancers of the overall flavor.  This will be one of our primary Super Bowl menu items this year, and for years to come.  ENJOY!",2012-02-02
73166,737491,4,1,"Made this chili for Super Bowl Sunday and it was great. I left out the sugar and chili sauce since I wasn't interested in the sweetness, and used canned tomatoes with chilis already in instead of the fresh chilis since we don't enjoy super spicy foods.

I use about 1/3 the brown sugar it calls for. I use a can of chopped green chilies instead of fresh. I like variety so I use red kidney, white kidney, and black beans. I use Amberbock beer and make sure the coffee is really strong. I once tried to use stew meat from the butcher, it was no where near as good as the sirloin....everyone noticed.  We love how it starts sweet and then the heat/spice hits. I've read reviews that it's too sweet, I encourage you to cut the brown sugar and try again. This chili has a great ""Chili"" flavor.

I made according to the recipe, although I only used 2 cans of beans...the poster actually said she cut the bean amount, so I felt that was okay on my first try on this recipe.  Maybe the extra beans take away from the sweetness, but I have always enjoyed a ""meat"" chili, not a ""bean"" chili, so tried for that. I enjoyed the mix of cubed sirloin and ground meat.....that is what I usually use.  I also do not use chili powder, basically making my own.  However, this chili is extremely sweet.  I can't say it is awful, but my mouth recoiled when I took a bite....it was expecting ""chili"", not candied baked beans.  This recipe is edible....but it doesn't taste like chili to me.  I'm giving this a 3 star, because it doesn't taste horrible, just not what you expect from chili.  I'm sad, because this is the first ""new"" chili recipe I've tried in years.....going back to my own tried and true recipe.***Letting this chili sit overnight lets the heat increase and temper the sweetness.

As someone who makes chili as a standard, and who grinds their own chili powder every two months with freshly dried, not old brittle supermarket chilis (the key), and who makes batches of mole (38 ingredients), in part to add to chili but also other uses--I feel safe saying I've had twice to three times as good.

If you have a sweet tooth, this is definitely the recipe for you. If you want a rich, authentic chile flavor, find a more traditional recipe that uses toasted and pureed chile peppers, which will have the flavor notes of coffee and beer.

Eliminate cayenne (unless you must have it hot). Eliminate chili sauce and use chili powder. Except, start with 2 Tablespoons. You can add another if you want it more spicy.

I heeded the warnings about it turning out too thin, so I added broth in gradually rather than all at once.

To offset the incredible amount of beans, I needed to add two more cans of tomatoes.  4 chili peppers?  Too much heat if serving children.  &lt;br/&gt;Recipe corrections:  &lt;br/&gt;1.  Coarse ground beef works better for chili than ground beef.  &lt;br/&gt;2.  A can of dark beer?  What size can?&lt;br/&gt;3.  A can of beef broth?   News flash- They make more than one size. &lt;br/&gt;4.  Ground coriander, not just coriander.&lt;br/&gt;5.

Also, more often than not, I brown the meat, onions, and garlic on the stove top and then just stick it in the crock pot all day (8-10 hrs) all day on low. When doing that, I'll add all of the beans at the beginning, but I do go with 2 cans kidney and 2 cans pinto. We've never found this too sweet, but that may be because we use home made (hot) chili sauce. I'll typically throw in a variety of sauces made from tabasco, cayenne, and habanero from the garden. For a &quot;smoky&quot; flavor, we'll char the 4 larger fresh chilis on the grill before chopping. I would say we usually get more than 6 servings out of this.

I keep most of the other main ingredients the same level even tho I’m adding much more meat other than an extra can of white beans of choice and maybe some veggies if I’m feeling it. I also swap out the diced tomatoes for... wait for it... SALSA. And double it. It gives extra veggies and flavor rather than just diced tomatoes. You’re welcome. ??Also - instead of all that mix of spices i just add a whole bottle of chili powder. It’s a mix of most of those and MUCH easier.

328600,1020526,5,1,"I found this in 2009 Taste of Home Annual Recipes, and although it's a strange time of year to make chili it was something simple and filling. The ingredients were too interesting to pass up. I would never have thought to combine black beans with pumpkin, tomatoes, and turkey on my own. This is an interesting combination. I made it even easier by using already frozen chopped onions and bell peppers. I also used fresh parsley and refried black beans in place of regular black beans.  It kind of has a tex mex feel to it with a touch of sweetness from the pumpkin. If you're expecting your typical chili, it's an adjustment.  If you can open your palate and your mind a wee bit, this is pretty yummy.  Thanks for posting!",2009-07-19
418358,520620,5,1,Excellent meatloaf!  I have tried soo many recipes and never really got excited about any of them.  I have now found 'the' meatloaf recipe no need to look any further. I had to make one change due to ingredients on hand I used quick cooking oats in place of breadcrumbs  Thank you so much for your recipe it is a keeper,2010-03-31
10373,29196,4,1,"We loved this. Quick, easy and tasty. The only change we made was to cook the onions in 2 tablespoons of oil (or 40 mls to us in Australia).

485010,355282,5,1,"This is a truly delicious salsa. I grew my own tomatillos, habanero peppers and cherry tomatoes this year so this recipe was perfect! The only thing I changed is that I halved the number of habaneros (and seeded them) and even then it was VERY hot! I also peeled the garlic before roasting it. Definitely a terrific recipe!

My daughter asked me to find a recipe for pop tarts when our local supermarket deleted them.  I made two batches today, one with the chocolate filling and one with the jam filling. The pastry dough was a dream to work with (I did add two tablespoons of extra milk but my eggs may have been smaller that what was called for). 
I think that these would freeze well too.  Thank you for the recipe, the kids want me to tell you that these rock!",2008-09-02

I made two batches of these, one with the brown sugar filling and one with homemade jam filling. Both turned out great and the taste is so much better than the store bought ones.

297282,1458003,5,1,Best pop-tart recipe by far.  I used nutella for the filling.  The pastry is so light and fluffy.  Taste best when warm-so eat them right out of the oven- or toast them in your toaster oven.,2010-08-15

Doing some pre-cooking before a medical issue made us order out again, and now my family has NO sympathy for me at ALL !
They suggested I have these treatments at least 1 time a month!
Used the recommended sauce listed...Creamy Mushroom Sauce recipe#149547 with the best results. 
I did add LARGE white mushroom slices as there was fresh beauties at the store, sauteed them seperately in butter and added at the last minute to prevent breaking, sprinkled entire dish with fresh chopped parsley...
Super easy with the best taste!
So much for being pampered! :)
Thanks Kitten!",2006-06-08
149540,325603,5,1,This recipe was excellent and I prepared the chicken ahead of time ( two hour) and put it in the fridge. Then popped it in the oven and increased the time by about 5 minutes. The sauce was divine!! Thanks for a great recipe,2006-06-28

Served to friends last night and they loved it so much ALL asked for the recipe! i had never thought of doing CHICKEN Wellington but i will always think of this if i want to impress. My only problem was getting the pastry to stick together, the water just didn't seem to do it so i used the egg wash to seal and coat them which worked much better.
Highly recommended!

149540,181447,5,1,I made this for a dinner party and it looked GREAT amd tasted even better than it looked I topped it with the mushroon sauce #149549 and it added so much. My guests were impressed with how it looked and tasted. Thankyou so much. ,2006-09-29
149540,301443,5,1,"Excellent!! My husband didn't think I could pull it off but he was sadly mistaken and praised me throughout every bite.  The only thing I'ld do differently is flatten out the chicken breasts, as they were to thick.  The dijon mustard was the big hit.  A very yummy dish! The only complaint I really have is the prep time seemed to take a long time.  Still a winner in my book",2006-10-12
149540,355531,5,1,"I made this tonight for dinner.  It was very good and definately worthy of company.  I found the cream cheese mixture a little bit overpowering and next time I will not put so much on.  But overall, it was really good.
For the mushroom sauce I just sauted some fresh mushrooms and threw in a couple scoops of cream of mushroom soup with some water and beef stock and made a very quick sauce.
Nice recipe, one I will use again!",2006-10-15

149540,275326,5,1,"'Wow' doesn't begin to state this one.  The flavors are just right together and the puff pastry crisps up just right.  I used chopped finely chopped mushrooms and chopped chicken breasts and made several smaller squares for a potluck dish that was adored for its deliciousness!  I was a little afraid of rolling out the puff pastry because I thought I would roll out all the 'puff' but it did end up puffing a little and it was very good.  The puff pastry did take longer to thaw on the counter, though. Another change I made...I seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash.  My only regret was that I didn't try the creamy mushroom sauce recipe.  Oh, well, I'll just have to make it again!",2006-11-26

My family was just too divided on the dessert.  I loved the toasted coconut & almonds but thought the rest could have used a bit more flavor.  Maybe a pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg added into the crust next time (I made a homemade crust).  DH didn't like the coconut at all, DS15 thought it was good but too coconutty & DD2 would only eat the creamy filling out of the mixing bowl but wouldn't touch it once the coconut was next to it.

365923,2000476973,4,1,Made this yesterday for Rosh Hashanah. I was so happy to find a potato kugel without flour or matzo meal! I did leave out the sugar. I&#039;ve never heard of sugar -- and so much of it -- in a potato kugel recipe. I also used far less oil. I heated a couple of tablespoons and mixed it into the batter and just greased the pan with a little more.

One year I hand-cut ""I [heart] D A D"" for Father's Day and surprised my husband...it was pretty neat.  Just brush the tops with egg wash as directed, add the cut-outs (like reindeer or stars for x-mas, hearts for valentine's) and brush them with egg also!",2007-01-16

149540,1054667,5,1,Made tonite for dinner with the creamy mushroom sauce and wow was I impressed. Did not change anything. Very much worth the effort. Can't wait to make it for my next dinner party.,2008-12-03
149540,1132830,5,1,"Delicious!  Made this, along with the creamy mushroom gravy, for guests this weekend - everyone loved it.  I'm not usually mush of a mushroom person, but even with the gravy, the mushroom flavor isn't overpowering.  I used Neufatchel cheese to save a few calories, but still used real butter and cream!  I may try this again soon with half-half instead of cream.  Overall, this is definitely a recipe I will make again for guests.",2009-01-19
149540,452921,5,1,Excellent.  Husband raved about this one.  Yummy Yummy!,2009-02-04
149540,1154939,5,1,"Fabulous!! I made it just as the recipe called for and it was amazing!! I'd definitely make it again, without a doubt. In fact, I can't wait to have it again. I made it with the Mushroom Gravy recommended in the introduction and that was to die for.",2009-02-22
149540,286566,4,1,"Overall extremely good but just way too must cream cheese (though the dijon mustard was a great touch) I think I would cut the cream cheese by half but still add they same amount of dijon and smear it thinly over.  My chicken breasts were about 180grams each (just over 6 ounces).  Our pre-rolled pastry sheets measure 24 cm square (about 9 1/2 inches) so I cut 4 sheets down for the wellingtons and used up some of the scraps for decorations - the rest I will use with cheese and herbs and make sticks with).  I did have to sub spring onion for the onion due to allergy reasons and used about 6 ounces of mushrooms and would consider using ghee/clarified butter next time with the oil.  An easy meal to put together that looks first class and tastes good - you can't go wrong.  Thank you Kittencal, made for ZAAR STARS tag game.",2009-03-24
149540,346991,5,1,This was fantastic.  Made this dish for hubby's birthday.  He loved it.  The dijon is a great idea.  I cut chicken breasts in half for the recipe- I think it made a more reasonable portion.  Thanks!,2009-04-05
149540,242729,5,1,"FAB Kitten Darlink! I cheated a LITTLE bit, as I had some cooked chopped chicken breasts left from another meal I made. As I am by myself at the moment, I cut this recipe back by two thirds, to make 3 wellingtons. I have just eaten the first one with a mixed salad out on the terrace in the garden, and it was DELICIOUS! The combination of Dijon mustard with the cream cheese was wonderful. I used Boursin cream cheese for an authentic French flavour! Made for the Whine and Cheese Gang for ZWT5, merci! FT:-) P.S. I made a lattice pattern for the top, just to make it look prettier!",2009-05-27
149540,526666,5,1,"This was good :-) ! I cut the recipe back to make only 2; I used 1 huge breast for both wellingtons, cut in half. This was easy to put together, as I have felt that wellingtons were intimidating. The dijon/cream cheese had a very interesting flavor! Thanks, Kitten, for another terrific dish!

Also used a creamy chevre rather than cream cheese.  Used a dash of cognac when I was cooking down the veggies - added great flavour.  Thanks for a great recipe, Kitten. :-)",2009-06-04
149540,237804,5,1,"I love this recipe!  I made this last night with rave reviews from all.  My DH hates mustard, so instead I mixed some basil, thyme and garlic powder into the cream cheese mixture.  We made it with the mushroom sauce and green beans.
It is a bit time consuming but I did everything at once versus some of it ahead of time.  Cooking the chicken or mushroom mixture ahead of time would make it come together faster.  Thank you for posting it!",2009-06-07

I had a hard time with my pastry, I think it had just been defrosted before.....so I ended up throwing the chicken (bite sized pieces) in with the cream cheese in a glass dish and covered it with pastry and baked as directed with egg wash on top. It was messy and not as pretty for company but it tasted wonderful! Thanks!",2009-08-31

149540,862341,4,1,Great!  IMO - the puff pastry works better for this recipe if you use 6 chicken breasts for the amount indicated and I also found it easier to work with when I did NOT wet the edges of it.  Thank you for sharing this terrific recipe!,2009-09-15
149540,63098,4,1,"We liked this very much. the first one i douldn't get the pastry to wrap around it. I used 2 large chicken breasts and fileted them to make 4 servings and 1 sheet of pastry. the second ""wrap"" i cut the chicken breast in half and tried that way still no dice. the last two I did a little different than instructed, I spread the cream cheese mixture (which is where I put the parsley -by the way) topped that with the mushroom/onion and then place sliced pieced of chiken on that then wrapped and sealed so the the ""stuffing"" would be on top while the seal was on the bottom. The 2 in which the toppings ended up on the bottom were a little soggy on the bottom when done. I didn't have any wine to make the suggested gravy, instead sauteed some mushrooms in a little EVOO and then added a dry brown gravy mix (mccormicks i think) that i had in the pantry- it was a nice sauce. also had with my own #357596 roasted potatoes and onions and some steamed brocolli and cauliflower. i very nice meal! thanks for sharing",2009-09-27

419089,325154,5,1,We bought this cookbook a couple of weeks ago and this is the 3rd recipe I have made. It is outstanding!! Tastes like a little bit of summer in a bowl. I used black bean as that is what I prefer and added frozen corn. Also increased the salsa to about 1 cup and used the entire red pepper. Plan on having this for lunch this week... and quite excited about it.,2010-05-02

My springform pan must be 10"" or so, because I found the cake a bit thin, and it was cooked at about 30 minutes.  Tasted great nonetheless!  I put the glaze in a ziplock baggie, snipped the end off and zigzagged the glaze across the cake.  Coworkers raved and DH and I enjoyed a generous helping ourselves.  I increased both the lemon zest and juice and blueberries just a bit.  Definitely on the make-again list!",2006-07-15

I did have to make a few changes due to availability of what was on hand... Garlic powder used instead of minced, canned corn instead of frozen (added during the cooling step), no chili sauce so I used Recipezaar's substitution recipe (which was perfect) and accidentally opened a can of green chilis, so I used that instead of salsa and added some wheat germ for nutrition.

I splashed about a cup of milk into the mac and cheese to make it creamier. Instead of sharp cheddar, I used velveeta for the Mac and Cheese, and then used parmesan cheese in the crust and sprinkled a little on top. I also left out the eggs thinking I knew better but that was the wrong step. DONT LEAVE THE EGGS OUT, its the binding agent for the crust.

I added some garlic salt, cumin, sugar, black pepper, additonal salt, and some recipe #143458 #143458 , to taste.  After adding the above, I tasted it again and liked it a lot (so did my family).

I added an onion, 2 T garlic after cooking chicken.  I added a couple of carrots and potatoes when it was simmering.  I think these added bulk and nutrients to the recipe.  I used red curry paste and increased the amount called for by a generous teaspoon after taking out my kids portion.  I used 4 B/S chicken breasts instead of thighs.  I also subbed lemon juice for lime and milk for coconut milk since I didn't have lime and coconut milk on hand... it would have been a little better with original ingreds.  I increased the turmeric to 1 1/2 tsp.  I served it over basmati rice and threw on some peanuts and raisins.

305248,209747,5,1,"Wonderful! Cooks up fast. Smells divine when cooking! The chicken was crispy and delicious. I followed your directions to a T with one exception. I used boneless skinless thigh fillets and ponded them very thin rather than the chicken breast as dh prefers dark meat. The sauce was very creamy and delicious. I used one shallot a little smaller than a golf ball and it came to a little over a Tbsp when minced very finely. Next time, yes I will make this again, I will use a white wine such as riesling instead of the red which made the sauce a purple color. Pretty color but dh turned his nose up at it. He did eat it and loved the flavor- what can I say- he is picky! Do slice the mushrooms thinly as they have a fantastic texture when done that way. Thank you for such an amazing meal that was lower in fat and calories than most German fare. I think this could even be lower if reduced fat products are used or yogurt rather than sour cream. I tried to reduce the oil used but really needed it in order to fry the chicken correctly. I did add in some cooking spray where I could rather than more oil.

164667,67728,5,1,"I've been hanging on to this recipe for quite some time, and I finally got around to making them. I made a few of changes due to family requests: I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour, added some cinnamon to the dough, omitted the raisins, and baked them instead of frying them. I still want to try them as written, but they were great even with the ""healthifying"" changes. I baked them on parchment lined baking sheets at 350F for about 25 minutes (until they were slightly browned). Because the ratio of whole wheat to white flour made them a bit drier, I served them warm with some warmed cajeta as a dip (definitely making them more nutritionally naughty, but who can argue with a little warm cajeta lol?). I'll definitely be making these again, because I can only imagine how good they must be with all white flour and fried! Thanks for posting!",2008-01-07

Makes sense though considering it is a 2:1 ratio of flour to shortening.

264809,197151,2,0,"Maybe I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe as outlined.  The bread was lumpy, and didn't rise properly.  It didn't seem like there was enough moisture in the dough.  Tasted good, but I think it would take me a few tries and some minor adjustments to get a well formed loaf.",2010-06-13
264809,107583,5,1,"I wanted a small loaf and this fit the bill.  Because I don't like the shape of any loaf in my machine, and I knew a small loaf would be a 4-inch FLAT square, I finished this off by hand, and baked in a small loaf pan.  I got a perfect snack-sandwich size loaf.  This is a light rye, so flavor is subtle.  As per a previous review, I used half light honey and half molasses for the dark honey.  Thanks for this keeper, for when we want just enough rye bread to go with our soup.",2011-08-14

I used barley malt syrup instead of honey and baked it in the oven after the bread machine was done with the first rise.

264809,400708,4,1,"The flavor of this bread is soooo good.  Strong rye flavor and just what I was looking for.  That said I did have some problems with making it, I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s not the recipe issue but probably as I&#039;m fairly new at working with rye bread.  I thought I followed the recipe and loved that it made a small loaf so that I didn&#039;t have a lot of waste.  The size turned out perfect for me and DH.  But while the ABM was working I noticed that the dough was really dry and crumbly - not coming together into a ball.  I added more water a tablespoon at a time and it took about a half a cup more before it began to come together as I expected. Being rye I expected a sticky dough not a dry one so this was a surprise to me.  When I did get the dough, it had a good rise and the flavor when done was just what I was looking.  Worth the extra effort.",2013-10-29
264809,873252,4,1,I agree with other reviews that it needs a little more moisture-dough ball was very dense and dry when I removed it from the bread machine. It also didn&#039;t rise much but I think my yeast was a little old. Loaf turned out very dense but still is very tasty! I didn&#039;t have any caraway but added some flax seed since my doc told me I have to start eating better! Will make again!,2014-01-16

176905,326523,5,1,"I had a handful of kirby cucumbers from the garden and little time, so I used this recipe and made a quart of whole pickles.  I made it refrigerator style, as in, I heated the brine and sterilized the jar, but didn't process in the boiling water bath.  I let it sit in the fridge for 2 days then nearly ate the entire quart in one sitting.  I reduced the salt in half, and added a few black peppercorns and a small slice of red onion.  I had to substitute a teaspoon of dill for each dill head because I didn't have any.  Truth be told, I heavy handed the dill and added 3 tsp to the quart.  I'll try this recipe again canning style next time.  I had to sit down and rate this immediately after opening the jar because they're so good.  This recipe makes a great polish dill.  Nice and tart.  Thanks for sharing!<br/><br/>Update:  This is now my go-to recipe for canning dill pickles.  I made 10 quarts this season from my kirby cucumbers.  I add 1/2 tbl of sugar to offset the tartness.  I love that this recipe makes a pint because, I was able to can as I picked cucumbers.  Canning right after picking kept the pickle crisp.  I finally got a crisp and flavorful pickle after years of trying.",2012-10-21

Pinching together the layers was easier and I didnt seem to have a lot of cream cheese mixture coming out. I used grainy mustard and it worked well, just right with the zip of the horseradish. The only thing I would like to have tasted was some flavor in the ground round, maybe onion and garlic or herbs.",2008-01-16
275778,149415,4,1,"Very good. I used brown sugar instead of Splenda. It was a little spicy for us, so I might not use the red pepper flakes next time. I always use Delaunes Cajun seasoning for anything that asks for cayenne, so that might have also been it. The adults loved them, the kids weren't as impressed. I cut the sweet potatoes really thin and tossed with a little bit of olive oil before baking for extra cripsness. Thanks for a good recipe!",2008-01-23

It was really good, so I looked for one to make at home with frozen pumpkin puree left over from Thanksgiving. This is the recipe I found and it is fabulous. So many layers of flavor. Can&#039;t believe more people haven&#039;t reviewed it, or maybe people just don&#039;t think of pumpkin soup. I did not add the cream at the end, but sprinkled a little crumbled feta in.

30388,37636,5,1,"This was a very delicious and easy to make recipe! The marinade time may have taken awhile but it gave me time to get the rest of my meal together, start the grill and get the coals ready, etc. We did cook our meat over coals, and the vegetables also, on a mesh grill rack- I made sure there were some jalapenos on there because I love the taste of those grilled on fajitas and soft tacos! The only other changes I made were to add a little bit of cilantro to the fajitas and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. They turned out excellent! It was supposed to serve 4 (among 3), but the only thing left was the odor, I have to tell you! Great job, Karen! :)",2002-06-12

I did marinade overnight as I find sometimes this cut of beef is tough but I also find marinading in beer really tenderizes. These were very easy and truely delicous. I would even use this combination for ones favorite cut of steak. Thanks Karen!,2002-07-10

30388,41874,4,1,Easy to make and really good to eat.  I got sidetracked with unexpected company so the marinating went on longer than called for but I think it simply made the meat more flavorful and tender.  I think next time I will add a little salt to the meat.,2002-07-29

Super easy to make - I prepped while my helper cooked and we had the whole thing done in less than 30 minutes.  We served it over baguette slices. My husband says next time we might wrap it in lettuce leaves (for the crunch), serve it with tortillas, add some shredded cheese or any combination thereof.

290173,164610,5,1,"Darnit, my review never showed up and I have to rewrite it... Made this last week and just got a chance to review it. I was in a really big hurry so didn't measure anything, just estimated. I halved this and tossed a couple slices of white bread into a baggie and mixed this up in a separate bowl. I only had pre-sliced, frozen bananas so opted to mash them into the pb mixture. I used 3/4 to 1 banana worth of slices. I used approx 1 to 1.5 T of honey, 1/8 cup of roasted/salted sunflower nuts, 1/8 cup shredded carrot, 1/8 cup raisins, and 1/2 - 3/4 cup Jif Creamy. I tossed it all into my lunch cooler and spread on the bread at lunchtime. I must admit this 30 year-old kid really enjoyed this. All the flavors went very well together and so did the various textures. If you choose to mash the banana instead of laying slices on each sandwich, refrigerating this will turn the banana brown (so this will take on a really ugly dark brown color), but it doesn't affect taste. Also refrigerating this might cause the raisins to get hard and chewy (it did to mine). This pb salad spread goes a long way depending on how much you want on each sandwich. I've eaten this many times since from the same batch. Makes a good and healthier version of a pb sandwich withotu sacrificing taste. Thanks for sharing this idea and making it into a good sandwich recipe. :)",2008-05-05

I then sprayed the bird with some butter spray and poured the broth over the spuds before spraying them too.

I used an already cut up chicken (pick of the chix) and it still came out super. I also sprinkled some plain breadcrumbs on top of the chicken, not even enough to cover it, to give it a little added texture.  I roasted for an hour covered, and then an hour uncovered, while basting it occasionally.   Great and perfectly crispy skin.  Even my picky 3 and 5 year olds liked it.   Will definitely make again.

I found that I had to lower the baking temp a bit after 20 minutes so that it wouldnt brown too much, but that varies from oven to oven. I was out of wheat bran, so I just threw in some flax seeds, which I liked.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing a true keeper, Ill make this over and over again for sure. Made and reviewed for the Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap November 2011.",2011-11-04
276822,570804,4,1,I have been making Irish soda type bread all my life and in many different forms.   The oven temperature given here is a little hot (hence the reason it browned so quickly before being cooked).  What works in my oven is 375 degrees - keep an eye on it - and probably have to reduce to 350 so that you can ensure it is cooked all the way thru.  Good recipe but just needs a few adjustments.  Ovens do vary.,2012-06-11
109427,104877,5,1,"Thank you for a great recipe.  I made it for 120 people and got raving review on it. Served it with a Caesar Salad, rolls and Pies for dessert. I will make this one again, just in smaller quantity. ",2005-04-10
109427,201614,5,1,"Thanks Evelyn, i made this for my sons theatre friends, it was easy to prepare and the results were delicious, unfortunately i forgot to buy the pearl onions , so threw in a few more regular chopped onions.Still wonderful !",2006-02-12
109427,452355,5,1,"My fiance and I made this last night and invited over two friends for dinner.  It turned out fantastic!  Everyone said they loved it.  It was very delicious and bursting with flavor.  I loved the sauce in particular!  The dish was not that difficult to prepare.  The only change I made was that I used cognac because I did not have brandy.  
I think the whole bottle of wine (versus the cup that other recipes call for) makes the dish and adds to the flavor.  Thank you for posting this.  I am filing this one away in my permanent recipe box!",2007-04-16

372574,526666,5,1,"It has been a long time since I made this; I forgot how easy it is and how GOOD! I had never tried a chocolate crust, so I did, and it was great! I used Nellie and Joe's key lime juice, as it is my fave and I did add 2 drops of green food coloring, personal preference...

20391,27643,4,1,This is very good! I used whole milk for extra body and added 1 t minced garlic. It was a very comforting soup on a chilly day. I sprinkled fresh snipped chives on top for color. A good easy recipe! Thanks Caryn I will use this recipe again!,2002-08-07
20391,199848,5,1,Great onion flavor!  I used fat free half and half for the milk.  It was nice and creamy and just the right thickness.  It's the perfect clam chowder for onion lovers.  Thanx!,2008-12-29

303467,41749,5,1,"Amazing recipe! A few minor changes as I couldn't find any lemon grass. I used chopped onion sprouts in the marinade and drained it through a sieve before marinating. I added 1 TBSP of mayo to the stuffing to help bind it. Also, the author has STEAKS and FILLETS confused - I used steaks, and the result was absolutely fantastic!",2011-07-23

32180,523848,5,1,I was going to post my recipe for pineapple pie when I found this one.  Like Carole I also use Sugar/fat free pudding mix and light sour cream.

118926,215092,5,1,excellent meal!  i served over white rice and it was wonderful!,2005-05-13
118926,227652,4,1,this was yummy! I left out the red pepper & decreased the paprika to 1/4 tsp. I also added 1/4 tsp onion powder. This was easy & flavorful & the chicken was moist. Next time I will add a slice of swiss cheese on top for fun! thank you ,2005-08-24
269284,114027,4,1,I roasted the asparagus as directed and used the sauce for dipping. I also dipped some spring rolls in the sauce with great results. Great way to add a little extra flavor to asparagus.,2009-02-22
269284,293410,5,1,"Superb, TasteTester! I poured the dressing over the asparagus in the last few minutes of roasting, since I felt like something warm. But I can't wait to try this in the summer with asparagus on the grill, and the dressing to dip it in! Thanks very much!",2008-03-24
269284,107583,5,1,Great!  I grilled the asparagus on the bbq and then tossed with the dressing.  Very tasty!,2008-05-17
269284,67656,5,1,I just love asparagus so this instantly drew may attention.  I grilled the asparagus on my indoor grill and tossed them about one minute from done into the dressing.  The warmth of the asparagus helped it to release the flavors of the garlic.  Altogether delicious. Made for 123 Hit Wonders.,2009-02-20
269284,428885,5,1,"We are asparagus loves here on the farm, in fact we grow our own, and this recipe will be repeated many, many times this coming Spring season.

233481,366914,5,1,"This was very tasty and quite beautiful to look at which is always a plus! I served it with Jasmine rice, which was a mistake the delicious light sauce was overshadowed by the flavor of the rice. It would have went with pasta a LOT better I will do pasta next time. The sauce was splendid I only added the 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and it was perfect. The flavor kind of reminded me of Avgolemono soup which I love. I was a little confused by the ""4 tablespoons of olive oil"" I couldn't find where to use the other 2 tbsp in the recipe. So I only ended up using 2 tbsp.",2007-10-12
233481,488587,5,1,"I totally forgot to comment- This was the best shrimp/pasta combination I have ever made! I added a little butter to the chicken broth and cornstarch, so it wasn't as healthy as it could have been =) This was a PERFECT combination with the asparagus! Thank you!!!!",2007-10-18
233481,530432,3,0,"This was light and healthy, but I cut back on the garlic a little and only put 2 cloves in as I was afraid it would be too much.  I should have put a little more in as the flavor of the garlic wasn't as prominent as it should have been.  I would have added butter and some parmesan to give it a bit more flavor, but overall a very nice meal over whole grain angel hair pasta...the asparagus was yummy this way!",2007-11-02
233481,241538,4,1,"The recipe was very good.  The lemon rind was a bit much for me even ensured that there was only the yellow.  I also agree with Lisa in Chicago, a little butter would have made the sauce just a bit better.  As a matter of fact that is what my daughter did, she added butter into her sauce and pulled out the lemon rind.  All was good!  The asparagus turned out very good as well as the shrimp.  We served it over jasmine rice and found it to be very superb!",2008-03-22
233481,62264,5,1,"Seriously delicious! Used 3 big zester strips of lemon rind (no white pith) which I then skinnied into 4 strips apiece. Used rather more broth (closer to a cup & a half so had to increase cornstarch to 1 1/2 t. Came together fast after prepping shrimp (shells in leftover chicken broth, olive oil & butter on the back burner now for stock). Added 2 T lemon juice at the end.  Served with steamed brown rice - yum. Wonderful recipe! This is a keeper in our house! Thank you so much for posting Cookin-jo!",2009-01-31
233481,197456,5,1,"very good recipe!  I pulled out the lemon rind based on a previous reviewer, as I don't care for zest.  After putting the shrimp and asparagus in a bowl, I sprinkled it with a bit of feta cheese.  YUM!  We served it with a green salad.  My 18 month old daughter ate everything on her plate, so that's a resounding yum for this dish! Thank you for sharing this recipe.",2010-06-01
233481,362983,5,1,"Mm, delicious! Well okay, so I was QUITE generous with the red pepper flakes, added a bit of light butter to the oil before I sauteed the shrimp, and I did skip the lemon zest, but it was all really delicious in the end. I also added red bell peppers when I started cooking the asparagus as well and it made for an even prettier plate. Thanks!",2010-06-07
233481,415934,5,1,This was crazy good.  I used about a dozen and a half large shrimp and one good sized chicken breast cut into chunks.  The sauce was just lemony enough. Just enough red pepper flakes to give a hint of spice.  Will make again!,2011-04-15
233481,1861521,4,1,"A keeper.  Made this recipe tonight.  Next time, I'll cut back a touch on the red pepper flakes...and cut the lemon strips into smaller strips, but it was a great recipe!",2011-04-15
233481,1887753,2,0,"I was excited to try this recipe since it got such great reviews and I love asparagus.  I have to say I was not a fan.  Too much red pepper and lemon, and would agree with other reviewers that the sauce needed butter.",2011-04-18
233481,182809,5,1,"I gave this recipe 5 stars...but it REALLY does not deserve it.  What it does rate is....500 stars!  This is the first time in all of my reviews that I had my socks knocked off.  I've had some great food from this wonderful community, but this made it on every level, ease of prep, quick cook, one pot, common ingredients, precise directions, and.....out of this world taste! I will acknowledge that I did not measure out but used the exact ingredients. Served it over basmati rice. Oops, I did change one thing, used Wondra flour instead of cornstarch. If you know me at all, then trust me and try this.",2011-04-21

I will definitely make this again. I can't think of any substitutions that would improve the dish. The lemon and red pepper amounts were right on. Absolutely the best meal in a long time. 5 stars.",2011-04-24
233481,1178797,5,1,"Made this today as a side dish to Easter dinner and it came out nicely. I did zest the lemon instead of making thin slices and used olive oil to saute the shrimp. I have coconut oil on hand and will try to remember to cook with that next time I make this tasty spring/summer dish. Coconut oil would be perfect with the shrimp and lemon, not to mention it can take the high heat. I used the chicken broth and cornstarch as directed, but the sauce did not thicken as much. Maybe increase the cornstarch to 1 tbsp and reduce the broth to 1/2 cup for next time. My husband liked the dish, thought the lemon was a nice and different touch and the level of spiciness from the crushed red chilies was perfect.",2011-04-24
233481,1655928,5,1,Fantastic!!!   I'm not a big shrimp fan but this dish may have won me over.,2011-07-24
233481,2007846,5,1,"I thought it was excellent. I did not use as much garlic, just two cloves, and the flavor was just right. I also added 2 sliced fresh portabella mushrooms and served it over pasta. Great dish!",2011-09-14
233481,126440,5,1,We loved this one!  I did roast the asparagus (8 min.) and added it at the end but otherwise as written.  We will definitely have this one often.  Quick and such great flavor.  Loved all the garlic.,2012-02-12
233481,1675225,5,1,Loved this restaurant quality recipe. Pretty much prepared as is.  I did use 1 cup of broth and 1 tsp. of cornstarch to increase amt. of sauce. I sauteed the shrimp in 2 T.  olive oil and then added the other 2 T when i sauteed the asparagus.  I did add 2 T of butter to sauce as well.  My sauce was a little bitter upon first tasting.  I had used 2 T of lemon juice and zest of 1/2 lemon.  I counteracted the bitterness by adding 1 T of sugar.  I served this over angel hair pasta.,2012-03-27
233481,509259,5,1,"Delicious, it is one of the best recipes I have tried from  this site. I did use 1 full can of chicken broth,( 15oz.) and 2 tsp of corn starch, as we wanted a lot of sauce t serve over rice. Otherwise I prepared as written.",2013-05-18

233481,2001336109,5,1,"Outstanding. I followed the recipe to a T except I did add butter at the end. However, what really brought this dish from good to outstanding was homemade fettuccine - totally worth the extra work. Trust me. You will be a hero at any party.",2017-02-16

I just recently came off of a 72 hour long fast and finally built up enough stamina to give this a go and it was INCREDIBLY good. The lemon and the pepper mingle together REALLY nicely in the sauce. Very light, INCREDIBLY potent flavors. Great recipe!",2018-07-28
71158,65631,5,1,"Wow! This is so good! I usually don't stray from traditional recipes. Like the typical mayo and mustard potato salad, but sure glad I did. I doubled this and it still wasn't enough for the seconds and thirds everyone went for!! ",2003-09-30
173762,113928,5,1,"This is soooo good!  It's basically a cheat's apple pie.  When I first read the recipe I thought the tortillas would go soggy, but the sauce makes them go really crispy.  I think this could easily serve 10 to 12, as it's a very sweet dessert, but I guess that depends on how many sweet teeth you have!  Thanks Kitten, for a great dessert recipe that will be sure to become a stand-by in our house.",2006-06-26
173762,25792,5,1,"Kitten...another winner! I too loved these, but could only eat a half at at time with some vanilla ice cream.  The warm sauce is best spooned over the top of the ice cream too and next time I think I could double the sauce.  They reheat well in the microwave but are the best when just out of the oven.  We loved them and this will be made many times.  Thanks Carol!",2006-07-05
173762,28636,5,1,You are right Kittencal - this is sooooooo delicious!  I made it for a Mexican carry-in at work today.  It was to die for!  One of my co-workers wanted to just eat the sauce.  I made one substitution (not the butter of course).  I used evaporated milk instead of the whipping cream and it was still extremely rich!  The addition of cinnamon and raisins to this recipe make it over the top.  It was easy to assemble and I tripled it and put it into a jellyroll pan for a large crowd.  Thanks for something new!,2007-01-24

They are so rich i/2 one is all most people could eat except my DH :)... I froze several of them & forgot about till last eve. We had 1/2 one each.I just reheated in microwave oven. They are just as delicous after being frozen.In fact we are having another 1/2 each for lunch. Thank you Kitten, this a recipe I will make again for a easy dessert.",2007-04-14

173762,299685,5,1,"OMG!!! These are totally to die for! Like another of the reviewers, I opted for 2% evaporated milk in place of the whipping cream but that was the only substitution. These were so, so easy to make and were completely delicious (I was eating the sauce like soup when the enchiladas were all gone.... yummmm). It took less than 10 minutes to assemble them and then I let them rest for 30 minutes while I made dinner (tacos!). Right before we sat down to eat I popped them into the oven and they were ready when we were done eating. If you like apple pie you will LOVE these delicious enchiladas.  Edit:  Okay... I have a confession... the sauce on this dessert was so dang good that I made some crepes last night, filled them with vanilla bean ice cream, then made the sauce from this recipe and drizzled it over the crepes ... finishing off with a few chopped pecans.  Ding dang they were good.  Thanks again for this yumilicious recipe!",2007-08-01

173762,1537628,4,1,Delicious with vanilla ice cream!  We used cherry pie filling (because it needed to be used up) and it was good.  The texture of the tortilla was a little weird for us but it could be that we didn't let the tortillas sit in the sauce for the full 30 minutes.  I'm with the others -- the sauce is incredible and will be used with ice cream!!!  Kittencal - you are a great cook and we're so very grateful that you share your delicious works with us!,2010-03-24

173762,2349265,5,1,"This was so easy and delicious! I used the small tortilla and it made 10 of them. I like the small because it is a rich dessert and it just makes for the perfect size. I followed directions exactly except for after they baked for 20 minutes I then turnedthe oven on a low broil for just a minute to bubble the caramel mixture that was on top of the enchilada and made it a pretty, crisp brown color. I also spooned the caramel mixture over the ice cream. Everyone loved it! I will definitely <br/>use this recipe a lot. I can't wait to try it with some cinnamon cream cheese mixture in with the <br/>apples. Yum! Thanks for a wonderful recipe.",2012-08-05

358875,1375473,4,1,"To review fairly, I was having some trouble as a bunch burned to the bottom of the pot while the rest remain uncooked-- this is the fault of my stupid wonky gas stove more than anything; words can't describe how much I hate that thing! I had to keep adding water throughout the cooking time (about 30 minutes) so more wouldn't burn. Otherwise, the flavor turned out very pleasant after I removed the burnt pieces and I did a half batch using a couple drops of storebought lemon juice and since I don't like pepper chunks, I used one of those little individual cups of Chi Chi's Snackers and tossed it in the blender with the other ingredients. That could be why it had a harder time cooking, but it's really because of how wonky my stove is and it burns stuff easily. Still a very pleasant slightly cheesy flavor though! I would make again once I have a real stove. Made for Veggie Swap 23.",2010-06-30
358875,37449,4,1,"The flavor was great in this! I halved the recipe and did have some trouble with it sticking on the bottom of the pan.

I can only imagine it tastes even better with the fresh.  Used some dry vermouth for the white wine.  I'll definitely add this to my favorites!",2007-06-08
93689,58439,3,0,"Sauce is GREAT, definately try again, TRUE!
Made duck outside on our BBQ!
Quicker, easier, which suited me,
Perhaps didn't come out exactly like published recipe,
Sauce would be great in chicken or pork,
Like to eat things without a fork!
Duck was a little fatty, perhaps that didn't help TRUE!
Had more bones/fat than meat too!
Thanks for allowing me to try this too,
Look forward to trying one ot the many recipes from you!

1.  Brown the steak on both sides over med-high heat to cook the moisture out of the steak before adding the glaze.  Cured ham does have a high water content.

2.  If you've the time, fire your oven up to 350F and add your steak and glaze for up to an hour.  The water will cook out of the glaze and you can turn your steak over and coat it with that wonderful sauce!",2008-05-14

The pudding layer, made as directed, is really stiff and hard to layer with the light, fluffy whipped topping.  Next time I think will try making each box of pudding per the box directions for a pudding pie and see if is easier to work with.

I used a very simple sauce (passata reduced with garlic and fresh basil). I had to shred bread to make breadcrumbs and I guessed what ""Italian seasoning"" is.

(Just the less fat thing) It is also my husbands absolutely favourite recipe.

Once my chicken had cooked, I placed the chicken on a baking sheet lined with foil and topped each piece of chicken with some nice thick freshly sliced mozzarella and broiled it a couple of minutes until the cheese was bubbly and getting several of those incredible tasting browned spots.

So we stayed at home and cooked these. We were sure glad we did, they were delicious. I ended up stretching the recipe to 6 chicken breasts and did pound the chicken to make them thinner. Since I had so many, I couldn't fit all six in a pan at once, so I cooked them till they were golden on the outside, then transferred them to a plate, poured some marinara on the tops, sprinkled parmesan, mozzerella and some parsley on the tops and microwaved them for a few minutes to make sure the inside was cooked through. We then put them on top of some noodles and more marinara, and it was to die for! I used recipe # 136292 for the marinara, and it was a great combo. Thanks for posting!",2008-12-01

25094,1366182,5,1,"Yum yum yum! My boyfriend and I had this for dinner last night with some buttery green beans and some ""Own Garlic Bread"" (found on Recipezaar). It was a fabulous meal! We have tried almost every chicken parm recipe on this site and yours is by far the best! It was VERY moist and cooked up nicely. We didn't flatten the chicken and it was still on the table in 20 mins flat.

The only suggestion I would make is to heat up some alfredo sauce in a small saucepan and serve that on top of the chicken if you prefer the two sauces over just the red. I do, and I think it complements the dish much more than just the red sauce!

Thanks for a fabulous recipe! We LOVED it and will be making this much more!",2009-11-11

I will admit I used bought breast fillet snitzels so it was less messy. I just made sure I chose the fattest ones I could find.

479156,204024,5,1,The instructions for this recipe need some editing. &quot;2-inch strips&quot; means cut the pork butt in two inch thick slices across the grain; it makes shredding easier later. It was unclear to us whether the instructions called for a double-shelled taco or just two tacos with cheese melted to the inside surface and peeled apart.  In both cases we improvised; in the end all was forgiven because these tacos had splendid flavor and displayed nicely.  Made for PAC.,2013-04-06

I added a pinch of cloves, used baby carrots grated in my food processor, and used whipped cream cheese (not light) in the tub for the frosting.

71756,5060,4,1,"The chicken was lovely and tender/juicey but we found the amount of herbs used was a little overpowering. I used whole grain mustard because that was what I had in, I will try it again with dijon mustard and will probably cut back on the herbs. Thanks for sharing Chia!",2006-10-16
71756,200862,5,1,"This was delicious. I love using honey and mustard together and the principle of the recipe is not new to me, but Chia's elements came together to create a very tasty dish. I doubled the ingredients because I had 10 chicken breasts (not very large) but I kept to the recipe. (I'll freeze half later). The only herb I didn't have was dried basil, which I substituted with rosemary. I was lucky enough to have dried French tarragon (so different from the awful Russian tarragon we get here) which I received in the Spice Swap from the garden of French Tart! I flattened the breats a little with a meat mallet to make sure they'd be tender. 

I didn't even have a good wine: I used a slightly sweet plonk which was in the fridge.

Chia, no 4 of the instructions could perhaps be changed -- it would be risky to place the chicken in the skillet in hot oil, and then brush on the marinade, and it's also almost impossible to do! I mixed the sauce in a larger bowl and dipped each chicken breast in the sauce, and then it went to the hot oil!

I'd also like to suggest that the sauce be tasted before using, to make sure the honey-mustard-herbs mixture tastes just right for individual tastes. The consistency of the sauce when reduced was perfect. This deceptively simple dish is quick, easy and delicious. Highly recommended! (A last thought: side dishes were brown rice, and steamed broccoli without any sauce or even salt, as it was so fresh. And I made a very large mixed salad. AND, NB: I got darling husband to taste the chicken and sauce when it was finished -- he said it was wonderful!)",2007-02-04

Because I dislike celery I added some baby orange bell pepper in its place and because the only regular onion I had was frozen, I used green onion. Initially I found the salad a little dry but a couple more Tbsp of mayo and a bit more lemon juice took care of that.

Also, I made some substitutions...instead of seasoning salt I used generous dill weed. I probably went a bit light on the cayenne pepper (instead of hot sauce). I may have used more lemon and garlic than was called for; I just kept adding until the flavor was balanced and nice. Also, I added much, much, much more mayonnaise than was called for (we don&#039;t believe in the low-fat craze!).

I had been searching for years for this recipe after tasting it at an international festival and was pleasantly surpised to find it here.  I would serve this as a dessert to company - it is sweet, caramelly, and a different twist on the idea of fruit & cheese as a dessert course.  It cooks in just minutes and worked well with ""just ripened"" bananas because they held their shape well.  Make sure to cut your cheese very thinly - so that it melts and gets all gooey quickly from the heat of the bananas.  After consulting with the recipe poster, I learned that the authentic cheese used is queijo de mantiega (butter cheese) if you can find that in your area.

This morning I decided to make brunch out of it so I took some leftover jasmine rice and mixed it with some leftover coconut milk mixed with a little sugar. I then cooked the bananas as directed but I cut them into round pieces. I then topped the rice with half the bananas and shredded the cheese b4 adding it to the dish and topping with more banana. I then sprinkled a little coconut flakes over the top. It was awsome! Yes, banana and cheese do go together well. Like HeatherFeather said, just ripe banana works well. Ours were actually still a little green around the edges. I will keep an eye out for the butter cheese but the mozzarella was wonderful and I usually have it on hand anyway. In fact, I usually keep all these items on hand so its a great recipe for thoes midnight snack attacks. I was thinking about trying this with plantains too.

I didn't measure the manchego, but was very generous with it and used a large cheese grater (versus slicing).  I also went heavy (3 Tb) on the almonds, which I greatly enjoyed in the dish.

Also, do NOT drink water!  The heat is in the oils, so you need to drink milk or cream; or eat butter or ice cream -- anything where the fat can be absorbed and diluted.

I think this recipe would work very well for a large dinner (up to the capacity of your oven). The sauce and vegetable quantities can be easily increased, and the rolls could be assembled and browned sequentially. Also, I believe you could simplify the preparation greatly by using a bottled steak sauce. I would omit the bread crumbs - they seem to only add bulk, not texture or flavor.",2008-06-16

306787,377039,5,1,"I'm not sure I should give a star rating; I made so many changes (due to what I had on hand) that it was almost another recipe entirely. Still, it was delicious and the aroma was amazing!<br/>I used super thin cut steaks instead of butterflying a thick flank steak. I didn't have wine, fresh basil or spinach, or prosciutto. I started by layering frozen chopped spinach, shredded carrot, chopped asiago cheese, dried basil, diced red onion, red bell pepper, dried thyme and bacon in a casserole dish; I baked it until the veggies were soft, cheese melted, and bacon cooked. Then I spread the steaks with the paste (made as described) and topped with the vegetable and bacon  mixture. Rolled them up and they were juicy and huge. Topped with salt, pepper, breadcrumbs and a little more thyme. I didn't brown the meat because they wouldn't hold together enough to tie... so I just placed them seam side down in the pan and roasted till they were done (about 45 minutes total). I checked halfway through and there was so much juice in the pan that it didn't need added liquid.  Once they were done, I removed them from the pan and added beef stock and the rest of the paste and Worcestershire sauce. Simmered to reduce and it became a lovely brown sauce that was delicious over the stuffed steaks.  We ate till we were stuffed!  Thank you for the inspiration and for an extremely forgiving recipe! I'm sure they would be even better made as described.",2011-10-31

The basil touch is also lovely.,2010-05-04

91608,4470,4,1,"I enjoyed this recipe but must confess I made a mistake while making it.  I forgot to put the cheese on the bottom shell so added it  for the last 15 minutes of baking. This took away some of the attractiveness of the dish because with the cheese on the bottom the peppers and mushrooms would show throught the top which I think would be very attractive.  The salsa comliments the flavor.
  I gave this recipe 4 stars because the instructions could be a bit clearer. I was not sure if the sausages should be whole or sliced. After 30 minutes the potato crust was  just beginning to brown and I think I would like it crisper and would have left it longer if the color was specified in the instructions.  I cut the recipe back to 2 servings (2 eggs and 2 sausages) - no problem.  I do not mean to sound critical - this is an excellent recipe and i will make it again.  However I will make sure the potatoes are hard pressed together, that they are fully thawed before pressing , slice the sausages and that I let the crust get crisper.
 This recipe will make a lovely Buffet dish for the holiday season  Thanks Laurierleen",2004-11-21

Very quick to throw together too. I reduced the amount of butter to 5T... but I still think it was a bit much and after the dip was heated through, it kept separating from the cream cheese which didn't look very nice.

98845,265905,5,1,This might be the best cut of meat that i have ever tasted.  I made it exactly the way it is written.  Thanks for printing it.  I sauteed the leftovers with onions and put them on a hogie with provolone cheese under the broiler and it was awesome!,2006-04-27
98845,66506,5,1,"All I have to say is...PERFECTION!  This marinade and blue cheese blend was awesome!  My DH loves blue cheese, I like it but not as much as him but we were both loved it!  Even my 14 yo who doesn't like blue cheese, loved the steak plain from the marinade.
We weren't able to cook the steak after the first day of marinating and had to wait an additional day,  2 days instead of one and it was all the better!!

98845,65803,5,1,"Hooray for sharing such a decadent recipe. I added one extra clove of garlic and fresh thyme to the marinade as I must have fresh herbs in everything I make.(Obsessive compulsive don't you think? Being a blue cheese aficionado, I doubled the schmear recipe so I was able to indulge like a slobbering mad fool. It was fab on the roasted potatoes which I don't normally eat (low GI diet) although this recipe begged for spuds. Thank you for sharing a lovely recipe which allowed me cheat. Double duty at the gym tomorrow.

98845,1275079,4,1,"I made this tonight. DH rated it 3.5 stars but since this is not an option I rounded up. I used about 1.22 pounds of steak and have plenty leftover for salads tomorrow night and a steak sandwich for DH tomorrow. <br/>This was great. I only marinated for about 3 hours because that's all the time I had. So it may have ranked higher if I had marinated for the time specified. I served on top of baby greens with scalloped potatoes. Also, I didn't have time or ingredients tonight to make the schmear so I just topped with gorgonzola (what I had on hand). Over all really good and I would make it again<br/><br/>Thanks kitchen guy!",2012-02-07
98845,185926,5,1,I used NY strips and this was excellent.  So nice and easy.  I did not grill the steaks but cooked in a cast iron skillet because it was too cold out.  Yummy.  Loved the schmear.  I do again.  Thank you.  P.S.  I had extra schmear left over and used it on toast.  So good.,2013-04-11
98845,546010,5,1,"We loved the marinade (4 hours) and Schmear. I&#039;ve decided I am not a fan of flank steaks, they are too iffy and rarely turn out as tender as I would like.  I cooked on a stovetop grill pan and they did turn out pretty well. An outdoor grill would be best but unfortunately the weather did not cooperate.

341816,1803632389,5,1,I haven&#039;t made this recipe but in an effort to help out future testers - I&#039;m not sure why anyone would put raw rice in - you really ought to cook your rice separately first.  Trying to cook rice in anything other than boiling water is just not logical.  So I&#039;m going to assume the rest of the recipe is decent and try to save the star rating but with the caveat to use COOKED rice and just add it in to the mix at the end.,2015-01-08

I had already started a batch of recipe #196201 the day before so I didn't do the garlic toast - I figured we could use the bread to sop up any juices.  As it turns out, this isn't an especially saucy shrimp dish (I should have gotten a clue from the flour in the recipe) but whatever sauce was there tasted *divine* on fresh baked bread.  I'll definitely do the garlic toast the next time, just to get the full effect.  Thanks for posting!",2008-08-03
367077,573325,4,1,"Syd, this is a very tasty and super quick and easy to make recipe! I had never made muffins using solely rye flour before, so I was excited how they would come out. The muffins are slightly drier than normal ones, but taste fabulous-like a soft rye bread. Due to the cinnamon they have a nice (almost christmas like) flavour and the raisins add a fruity sweetness, which pairs well with the honey. Next time though I will add some more of those little morsels. :) All in all these were a tasty healthy breakfast treat. 
Thanks so much for sharing with us, Syd!

367077,1613267,4,1,These muffins were pretty good. I was surprised at how light the texture was using only rye flour. I put dried cranberries in mine and I like the flavor combination. The recipe is a little dry and a little bland for my taste though. I might add more honey or some molasses if I made this again.

91185,385661,4,1,"For the semisweet chocolate and strawberry layer one word describes them: delicious. However I did not care for the white chocolate layer - I'm not quite sure why.
I managed to pour the white chocolate layer over the semi-sweet easily - my mum poured the strawberry on top and I'm not quite sure what she did but she made white come through, so mine looked nothing like the picture.
 I was a bit anxious that the mixture was going to overflow however, it did not rise much. I used a digestive crust, and also found the chocolate topping hard to cut though. Maybe next time I'll use a pureed strawberry topping.  What I like about this recipe is you can do soo many things with it e.g triple the amount of strawberries for a just strawberry cheesecake. Or just use two flavors and marble them together.  I did find this recipe created quite a lot of washing up but it was definitely worth it.",2007-05-25

Instead of chicken broth, I used Pho broth. You can find this at any Asian market. The flavor that it gave was rich. I also made sure to get the fish sauce that had less sodium. If you look at the reviews you notice that the soup has over 1,000mg of sodium, so by looking closely at the fish sauce label you can choose one that is healthier. Another Ingredient that I added was Basil that was added at the end to intensify the pho broth.

My husband thought it tasted like a steak, so of course he was happy since he only believes in grilling red meat and doubted that a grilled pork chop could be so tasty! Oh, and I had pork chops that were 3/4"" thick and I cooked them for about 8 minutes on each side, which I believe was too long since they dried out a little too much for my preference. I might suggest just 6 minutes on each side, pull them off and check them, and if needed, then throw them back on if they aren't cooked enough.

251215,286566,5,1,"Made this for the DM as a light dinner and as she does not like spicy I used ham in place of the salami and used recipe #226233, I used 2 medium potatoes and baked them in the oven as I already had it on and scooped as much of the potatoe out as possible as I knew the DM would not eat the skins and she thoroughly enjoyed.  Thank you Jewelies, made for Make My Recipe - Edition 11.",2010-07-10
141547,145352,5,1,"Wonderful! I actually added a lot more hot sauce, cuz we like a zing, and still my DH said it coulda been hotter!!! I had to add water a couple of times during the roasting, a total of about 3 hours. This will become a regular at our house! I served it with garlic mashed potatoes.",2007-01-08
141547,400708,5,1,"This is one of the best beef recipes I&#039;ve made in a long while.  For me and DH it was just the right amount of spice, the meat was fork tender and the gravy to die for.  I cooked mine for 1 1/2 hours and it was perfect.   Tonight is left overs and can&#039;t wait.  It went together so easy that it&#039;s something that can be used on those really busy days like ours was yesterday and no worries.  Think it could also be adjusted pretty easily for the crock pot.  Regardless the house smelled so good while this was cooking DH kept coming and asking &quot;when can we eat&quot; that in itself makes this a 5 star recipe for me.",2013-10-10
163362,133174,4,1,"A nice quick side dish.  By using frozen peas and corn, I left off the water and microwaved the vegetables, added the butter, dill and pepper.  Gave it a quick stir and it was ready to serve.  Thanks for sharing.",2007-04-29
326457,490783,5,1,"This was absolutely delicious!  A very healthy and satisfying meal, especially on a cold day.  The spice combination rocks!",2008-11-05
326457,678366,5,1,Really unusual combination of spices but so tasty! I tried this with chicken but I'll make the vegetarian version too. Even better the second day!,2009-09-27
326457,573325,5,1,"Wow, what a super yummy, spicy chili!!!! It was soooo good!
The different spices go really well together and make for a flavour experience, that is very special. I especially liked the cinnamon in this.
As I dont like celery that much, I simply left it out and used a little more carrot to compensate for it.
Your directions were spot on and everyone enjoyed this chili a lot. THANKS SO MUCH for sharing it here with us, Umberle. We will make it again.
Made and reviewed for one of my babies in PAC March 2010.",2010-03-29
326457,308434,5,1,Absolutely wonderful!  I reconstituted dry garbanzos to cut down on the sodium.  I didn't have any cilantro...but I did have spinach.  I put a couple of handfuls in the pot after it had finished cooking...just to let it wilt.  There was enough leftover for tonights dinner...so I am adding the cilantro when I reheat.  Thank you so much for this really yummy dinner.,2010-03-30
88143,133625,5,1,This is the PERFECT sauce for tuna.  I made half of recipe.  To get it to thicken does take some time.  I never seed or skin a tomato-but I did chop it up fine and mixed it with the green onion and let it drain in a collander while I put together the rest of meal. The flavor of lime and fresh ginger cream on grilled tuna with the tomato and onion on top is something you would find in a high priced restaurant.  Thank Winkki!  ,2004-04-17
88143,56680,5,1,"This was wonderful over seared tuna that DH caught off the coast!  I used walla walla sweet onion for the shallots and the green onion, followed everything else to a tea.  I also ate some of it on my roasted taterrs.  DH raved over it too, Thanks for a keeper Winkki!",2006-09-10
41219,43005,4,1,This recipe was right on target for my family.  I didn't change a thing.  It was simple to prepare and looked nice coming out of the oven.  The best suprise was that none of the flavors was over powered by the others.,2002-10-05
41219,51086,5,1, This recipe was a BIG hit in our home.  I had no Hamburger(some one came home for lunch) so I used a Veggie subsitute (Morning Star Farms hamburger subsitute).  I also used turkey bacon. It was excellent and the left overs were eaten for breakfast. This recipe was one of the best one I have tried thus far!! Thanks!!,2003-01-31
41219,36890,5,1,Good and easy.  I made it just like it's posted- then I started experimenting with different meats and cheeses.  This is a keeper,2003-07-22
41219,68928,5,1,Very delicious!  Quick prep.  Great weeknight meal.  Thanks for posting this low carb recipe!,2003-11-04
41219,357323,5,1,"This was great! I had tried a meat crust for another recipe and it didn't turn out very well, so I was a little skeptical about this one. The crust didn't really hold up in this recipe and kind of mixed with the egg part. It was still very good though, so I didn't really care. Hubby said ""You definitely have to make this again"".",2007-02-13
41219,808227,5,1,This is a great recipe.  It is one of my staples when I don't have any food in the house because it is so easy to make.  Sometimes I substitue milk for the half and half & it still comes out fine.,2008-04-06
41219,811149,5,1,"Yum! I used ground turkey, egg beaters, fat free half and half and ww cheese and it was still delish! This went quick!",2008-06-06
41219,971377,5,1,"This was great!  The only thing I did differently was used milk instead of half & half, and it turned out wonderful.  My whole family loved it, even my picky 2 year old.  Will definitely make again!",2009-01-29
41219,369715,5,1,We all loved this. I made as directed other then I used onion powder instead of chopped onion. I just sprinkled it on and didn't measure it. I also added a cup and a half of cheddar cheese. I did add black pepper to the egg/cream/cheese mixture and again I didn't measure it. I didn't add the optional garlic powder. I was a bit surprised how good this was. I had frozen precooked hamburger so this made it very easy to put together. I will be making again.,2009-06-05
31921,324136,5,1,"Yum yum yum... I swear I will never make another potato bake again!  The cheese is strong enough to make it unique tasting, but non-blue cheese eaters will never notice.  I topped with normal low fat cheddar 10 minutes before it was finished and it was delicious.  I also used normal onions, and did layers instead of combining in a bowl.  The thyme was a nice touch, use lots of pepper! Thanks!",2009-01-06
31921,1072593,5,1,"I love this the way a baby loves his bottle, the way an aloholic loves a bar, the way a gambler loves a casino...just sayin'!  Made for Edn'8 A/NZ.",2009-08-02
