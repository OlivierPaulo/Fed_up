a little history:
in the early 1920's, stephen mather, the national park service director, realized that the park needed accommodations to suit the affluent and influential traveler. the concept of a hotel such as the ahwahnee became the impetus to draw such a visitor.

the site for the ahwahnee, once a village of the native miwoks, was chosen because of its exposure to the sun and stunning views of yosemite's icons – half dome, yosemite falls and glacier point.

in july 1925, gilbert stanley underwood was selected as the architect for yosemite's new luxury hotel. due to its remote location, the construction of the ahwahnee was the most complex trucking endeavor of its day. over 5,000 tons of stone, 1,000 tons of steel, and 30,000 feet of timber were hauled over the challenging mountain roads. to protect the ahwahnee from fire, a fate of many of the park's earlier hotels, its wood-like facade is actually concrete, poured into rough-hewn wooden forms and stained to look like redwood.

today, the ahwahnee is a major attraction to visitors to yosemite as they explore this unique relationship of architecture and nature.","yosemite celariac soup time-to-make, course, main-ingredient, cuisine, preparation, occasion, north-american, soups-stews, eggs-dairy, vegetables, american, french, easy, european, dinner-party, holiday-event, vegetarian, dietary, californian, 4-hours-or-less roasted garlic, olive oil, yellow onions, butter, parsnips, celery root, russet potatoes, marsala wine, bay leaf, thyme, star anise, vegetable stock, heavy cream, pepper, salt",2007-07-07

if it's unlikely for you to get breton salted butter, use whichever good salted butter you can find and flick few grains of coarse crunchy salt before folding the dough in layers and across the top before baking. it's a pretty good approximation of the real thing.
(2)this is a very sticky dough since it's rich with butter and sugar. you should have a metal pastry 'bench' scraper or a metal spatula handy to help with turning, as well as to keep the dough from sticking to the counter top.

(3)work fast. letting the dough sit on the counter and warm up is not a good idea. roll quickly.

(4)although i recommend waiting about 1 hour between rolling out the pastry layers, you can wait several hours (or overnight) for example, if you don't want to stick around.

i promise never to post a recipe that hasn't passed the ""kid test"".  i have four kids who are very, very finicky eaters.  my kids can tell that these aren't made from real sugar - mostly because i don't have real sugar in my house anymore.  but they still love these.  i have also served these to friends without anyone knowing they weren't ""normal"" pumpkin bars.

i started looking for a sugar substitute when a dear friend had surgery and became completely intolerant to any processed sugar.  splenda doesn't agree with me and i always prefer 'natural' options when possible.  xylitol is more expensive than sugar, so experimentation is frustrating sometimes.  i hope you will enjoy my successes without having to endure the waste i've had.  it has 40% less calories than sugar, 75% less carbs, and has a glycemic index of 7 (compared to sugar at 68 and corn syrup at 100) and my friend can enjoy sweets once again!

the key to using this in place of sugar is to melt the xylitol before adding it to the recipes.  i just melt mine in my pyrex measuring bowl in the microwave.  i have found it's very important to melt the xylitol but not boil or otherwise over-heat it, because it does alter it's consistency like sugar.  if you heat it too long, when it cools, it becomes rock hard.  (i'm still figuring out how to use this to my advantage in fudge and caramels - i'll post when i get a successful outcome.)

this pumpkin bar recipe is an adaptation of one i have in an old better homes and gardens cookbook.  i also use only whole-wheat flour and try to skim some of the fat (though not all, in order to keep a nice degree of moistness).

i buy my xylitol online.  some bigger cities might have natural/health food stores that sell it in the store, but nothing near me.  i pay about $25 per 5 pound bag, so shop around.  for me and my family, the switch is worth it.","sugar free pumpkin bars with cream cheese frosting 60-minutes-or-less, time-to-make, course, preparation, occasion, for-large-groups, desserts, diabetic, fall, cakes, cookies-and-brownies, bar-cookies, dietary, seasonal, number-of-servings whole wheat flour, wheat gluten, xylitol sweetener, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, canned pumpkin, cooking oil, sugar-free applesauce, eggs, cream cheese, butter, vanilla",2009-10-19

one and only time she made that same cake.  but you have to hear the story behind this one.  my cousin janice and i spent a lot of time together when we were kids.  mom cooked but truth be told she was not the best there was.  this one day, however, mom decided to try her hand at pineapple upside down cake.  ok...from now on i'm calling it pud cake...way too much to type.  anyway, she spent the better part of a morning really concentrating on this recipe.  when it came 
out of the oven -- it looked pretty good!  wow!  mom made a pud cake!!  of course, jan and i stood ready with forks and plates but mom said we had to wait for dinner, to go outside and play and she had better not find finger marks in the cake.  so not wanting to risk a whipping, we went outside knowing that in a couple of hours she would call us in to wash up and eat.  man, we would have 
endured burnt brussel sprouts and liver just to get to that dessert!  after a while, we noticed that mom had gone across the street to chat with a neighbor.  naturally the plot was hatched to sneak inside and maybe we could slip a finger up under the cake for a 
nibble without it being noticed.  ok...so remember the whole shock and awe thing on tv with the war?  nuh-uh -- we had the first shock and awe incidents ever recorded in history. mom had left the cake on the buffet on a glass pedestal and covered with saran wrap.  the saran wrap was disheveled beyond belief.  huge crumbs were laying all over the buffet and on one side it looked like the cake had been literally attacked.  big chunks were missing!  man!  we didn't do it!!  i mean, for real -- this time we could truthfully say we didn't do it.  but who did?  ok, that was shock and awe #1.  here we are standing there staring at the destroyed cake with ragged pineapples and cherries hanging off the cake plate.  kids are basically pretty dumb.  had we any clue at all, we would have run for the hills because shock and awe #2 came when mom threw 
open the front screen door, took one look at the cake, one look at us standing there staring at the cake and it was on!  this was one of those whippings where your mother just comes out swinging and what's worse, she's talking in between each blow.   you can hear it, can't you?  ""didn't i tell you..."" thwack thwack thwack ""...not to touch that cake..."" thwack thwack thwack  ""...after i spent all morning..."" thwack thwack thwack  you feel it, don't you?  ha ha!!!  we did too.  the whole time the three of us are running around the dining room table.  the dust balls must have 
been rolling around laughing.  it all looked really comical.  mom going one way, us going another, trying to dodge the bullets until she finally tired out and made us go sit on the steps in the front hallway.  now, here's me and jan, sitting on the steps punished.  and this time we really were innocent!  
mom is still in the kitchen and she is pissed.  just then, jan pinches my arm and says, ""a!""  (family calls me ""a"") ""...look!!!""  there at the front door stretched out in the hot sun 
streaming through the storm door was dusty...our old gray alley-turned-house cat.  she was cleaning herself as cats do...taking long luxurious strokes with her tongue of pud cake embedded in her fur 
and paws!  dusty was the culprit!  the cat ate the cake!  so we start calling, ma -- 
""maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa""  ""sissyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"" (jan called my mom sissy)   ""look!!!""  she comes storming out of the kitchen and we are off the steps pointing at the cat.  ""dusty ate the cake.""  and do you know what this woman says to us?  ""don't you blame that poor cat!  you all probably fed it to her.  didn't i tell you not to give that cat people food?""  no way!  we're still on punishment and now for 5 extra minutes because we got up off the step to lie on the cat!!!???   aaarrrgghhh.  but later that night, shock and awe #3 came at the one and only time mom apologized for a whipping.  
we had gone to bed.  mom was in the kitchen and hearing peculiar noises from the dining room, she found dusty back at it hot and heavy.  so there....now you know where shock and awe really came from and why mom always felt too guilty to ever make pud cake again.  oh and by the way, we never figured 
out what really happened to that cat.  enjoy!!!","pud cake  by emeril and with a long story from me time-to-make, course, preparation, desserts, easy, cakes, dietary, 4-hours-or-less pineapple, unsalted butter, light brown sugar, pecan halves, cake flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, granulated sugar, eggs, buttermilk, vanilla extract, dark rum, fresh cherries",2007-06-22

tips:
do not let this hot slaw sit around with dressing in it. it must be fresh!
don't over fill the bowl with dressing. i personally like just enough dressing to wet the cabbage and bacon and not a drop more.
make a whole gallon of dressing and bacon bits and store what you don't use for later. at forest view gardens, we made 30 gallons of dressing and 200 pounds of bacon bits on thursday and it lasted the whole week!","absolutely best hot slaw recipe bacon, 60-minutes-or-less, time-to-make, course, main-ingredient, cuisine, preparation, occasion, for-large-groups, salads, side-dishes, pork, vegetables, german, european, fall, holiday-event, winter, salad-dressings, dutch, dietary, christmas, thanksgiving, seasonal, low-carb, egg-free, free-of-something, low-in-something, meat, greens, number-of-servings, presentation, served-hot, nut-free cabbage, bacon, water, vegetable oil, white vinegar, sugar, salt, fresh garlic",2013-06-24

you will need a *springform* cake pan, or a lot of patience, or you will not be able to get the pie out!

because dutch recipes generally use grams instead of cups for dry ingredients, i have included the measurements in grams as well.

the dough is shortbread-like and may take a lot of time to get right. it took me ages to get it to form a ball, but it worked out fine in the end. if you're getting tired of it, add a little milk, but don't despair for with or without the milk, it *will* from a ball in the end.

if you want, you can prepare the apple mixture the previous day and keep it in the fridge, the flavors will blend wonderfully. if you want to prepare the dough in advance, take it out of the fridge in time, because it's really hard to work with when it's just been in the fridge for a whole night.

the preparation time is a rough estimate and assumes that you peel the apples while the dough is in the fridge. i'm quite slow at preparing so it could be anywhere between 1 and 2 hours for you.

last but not least, *do* make sure you have a bit of dough left over for the third to last step - you deserve a little something for all that hard work! :d","dutch apple pie  oma s appeltaart lactose, time-to-make, course, main-ingredient, cuisine, preparation, occasion, low-protein, pies-and-tarts, desserts, fruit, oven, european, kid-friendly, vegetarian, pies, belgian, dutch, dietary, free-of-something, low-in-something, apples, taste-mood, sweet, equipment, presentation, served-cold, served-hot, 4-hours-or-less self-rising flour, butter, brown sugar, vanilla essence, salt, apples, raisins, granulated sugar, cinnamon, lemon juice, egg, semolina",2005-07-05

this recipe does have some heat from the chiles, but this can be modified to taste. if you hate heat, leave them out. if you like very little heat, try using a poblano chile. if you like a slight bite, i would use jalapeno chiles, and cut them open and remove the seeds. if you want more heat, leave in the seeds. if you want to go hotter than that, i would try serrano chiles. if you want hotter than that, i'm sure you know what chiles to use. lol 
another note: like all produce, tomatillos can vary in flavor and tang. taste the salsa..if you think there's too much tang, try adding some more onion and herb. if you like less cilantro, feel free to reduce. this recipe was shown to me in handfuls and bunches, so it is very flexible. to store it, i simply keep it in an old mayonnaise jar in the fridge.","fresh tomatillo salsa 15-minutes-or-less, time-to-make, course, main-ingredient, cuisine, preparation, occasion, north-american, low-protein, healthy, sauces, condiments-etc, vegetables, mexican, easy, low-fat, vegan, vegetarian, salsas, dietary, spicy, low-sodium, low-cholesterol, low-saturated-fat, low-calorie, low-carb, inexpensive, healthy-2, low-in-something, taste-mood, savory tomatillo, cilantro, green chili, green onions, lime juice, salt",2006-08-24
