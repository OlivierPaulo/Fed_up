45119,12657,3,0,"The instructions in this recipe are very lucid and easy to follow, but the end result was a little drier than I had hoped. The combination of ingredients worked well but it lacked the 'juice' that perhaps a chopped tomato could have provided. I topped this with a good amount of plain yogurt before serving and that did make it less dry. Thanks for posting, Karyl.",2003-07-30
45119,74736,5,1,"Thought this was delicious Karyl, it's nice to know sweet potatos CAN be made without brown sugar or marshmellows! This recipe almost reminded me of some smothered hashbrowns we had that were enjoyed all around, only a lot less greasy:)",2004-03-26
45119,1802694935,5,1,I found this to be a very good take off on sweet potatos.  The use of olive oil was a good addition to this recipe that really made the difference.  The sweet peppers were also a plus.  For something different.  Go this one!!!,2014-11-27
381108,655199,3,0,"This was pretty good, but could've used a little more seasoning IMO...couldn't really taste the Worcestershire sauce. Granddaughter's (7 & 3) loved it! Will make it again, but will add some seasonings. THANKS!",2009-07-15
54550,68460,5,1,"Another good recipe!  I made this exactly as written using 1 pound of white button mushrooms and 1/2 pound baby portobellos.  This soup has a rich, earthy flavor and smells wonderful while it's cooking.  It was the perfect meal for us on the cold, rainy day we were having.  I served it with Caesar salad and hot rolls.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe, it's going into my permanent recipe file!",2003-03-22
54550,65056,5,1,"I made this as part of the Comfort Food Cook-a-thon and I'm so glad I did!  My boyfriend decided this is his new favorite soup (and I make a lot of soups) and ate a bowl of it with breakfast, lunch and dinner until it was gone.  I made it a week (or more) ago and he's been bothering me every day to make more!  I dodn't have any bay leaves, so I used some thyme and other spices to taste.  I used a mix of white button and crimini (these are the same thing as baby portobello, by the way, for those who don't know).  I also used one small-medium unpeeled russet potato.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  This tastes completely gormet and really isn't much work, less slicing all the mushrooms.  I know I'll be making this again (by BF demands it!)  Thanks so much for posting.",2003-11-20
54550,80353,5,1,"Truly delicious and so easy to make!  I used a combination of button mushrooms and oyster mushrooms (no portobella here today) and the flavour was outstanding.  Soothing, satisfying, and the barley added just the right touch of toothsomeness.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that goes in the keeper file!",2004-01-03
54550,123640,5,1,"This recipe was very well received at our house.  I thought it was a good, tasty soup, but my husband and a visiting friend practically inhaled it, and hubby has been demanding it ever since.  I made the recipe as-is the first time, and added 1/2 tsp thyme after that.",2004-03-07
54550,116315,5,1,"Like the other reviews, a very good soup, it smelt so delicious and was too.  I added about 2 tbsp. of sour cream to each bowl full and this was what I was missing in my personal taste.",2004-05-21
54550,37779,5,1,This is a very soul-soothing delicious soup. We are just starting to get bitter cold weather here and I am so glad I had this soup to enjoy. I used a combo of baby bellas and button mushrooms. I made no alterations and the flavor and smell were excellent. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Will make again.,2004-12-20
54550,246898,5,1,My mother says this is the best mushroom barley soup she has ever had. I put some in the freezer to save and she took it back out to serve to company. I added some additional barley and I simmered the soup for an hour. Will be making this often.,2005-10-02
54550,108902,5,1,"Wow. This is sooo amazing. It took me a little longer than I expected with all the chopping of vegetables, but it was worth it. I didn't have barley, so I used Instant Brown Rice. I'll be making this often. Thanks!",2005-10-30
54550,223325,4,1,"A very tasty and enjoyable dish, but I think you might consider it more of a stew than a soup. Either way it was delicious!!",2005-11-03
54550,278207,5,1,"This soup reminded me of the traditional mushroom soup my family made every Christmas Eve, only with more butter and minus the carrots and potato.  It took me forever to cut up all the veggies because I'm not a good cook.  Regardless, this soup turned out delicious.  I still can't believe I made something so good.",2006-01-01
54550,39835,4,1,Very good soup which we enjoyed with popoovers. Instead of the chicken broth I used half chicken broth and half vegetable broth--next time I think I'll use all vegetable broth to make it a vegetarian soup. Thanks for sharing!,2006-02-13
54550,62043,5,1,"This was an extremely delicious barley soup. The addition of portobella mushrooms added a meaty, woodsy taste that was very appealing. I will definately make this again. Thanks!",2006-10-10
54550,362983,4,1,"Great soup. Very easy to make and it was hearty and delicious. I added lots of herbs to the soup, though I would probably add some seasonings when sauteeing the vegetables to add some more flavour to them in the soup since they seemed a little bland to me with just butter. Still, very yummy!",2007-01-02
54550,208125,5,1,"Very delicious, the mushroom flavour wasn't drowned out by the other ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly and we thought that it didn't really need the potato but the soup would be great either way.",2007-11-01
54550,203111,3,0,"This is one of those soups that shouldn't be served until the next day, IMO.  It was ok the first day but I had my doubts about making it again because it takes so long to cut up all the vegs.  But I decided it was all well worth it when I had a bowl the next day. Yum! I did add about 1/4 cup of cream to it.",2007-11-04
54550,149075,5,1,"a lovely, nourishing soup. I only used half the butter, and just a little oil to saute the veggies. I added a touch of sherry towards the end to enhance the nutty flavor of  the different mushrooms I used. The family loved this soup.",2009-05-20
54550,206213,4,1,"I made this soup yesterday, with adjusted menu for 4 people - DH dislikes too much barley :>( doesn't know what's good for him!
I have to say I wasn't overly impressed with the initial flavour, so added some good frozen(then defrosted) chicken stock to it. Today I reheated it and felt the flavour had much improved. I really enjoyed it -- DH said- less barley and more potato -- I disagree as I love barley. I don't know that it will be a regular on  our soup menu, but I'll will have it again - for me!!! Thank you BoxO'Wine because I love soup and it's always  good to have a go at something different from the norm :>)",2009-06-24
54550,234075,5,1,"Very good. I used olive oil instead of butter, and added about a tsp dried thyme, little bit of rosemary, and finished it with a generous dollop of chardonnay. The next day, the flavor had become rich and full bodied. Thanks for posting. I will make this again!",2010-01-03
54550,545970,3,0,"I liked this and it was better the 2nd day.  I'm only giving 3 stars because no one else in the family would eat it, even the mushroom lovers.  If I were to make this again, I would chop all the mushrooms (instead of the slicing) and double the barley.",2011-01-23
54550,744367,0,0,"This soup was delicious. i only made a couple changes.  I used one can of beef broth, one can of chicken broth and 2 cans of vegetable broth. I also used salted butter since thats what i had on hand. I sliced some shitake and baby portebellos too to add to the mix, they were a delicious addition.  I am giving it 5 stars and would give it more if i could because it was my 11 and 7 year old that ate ALL of the soup!  I had a bowl before i napped before my 3rd shift job, and when i awoke, looking forward to bringing a bowl to work with me, it was GONE!!  DH told me that they each had 2 helpings for dinner, and the kids begged for more later till they finished it!  Needless to say, im on my way to the store after writing this review, to get some more mushrooms to make a double recipe for tonights dinner :)  oh, let me add that i also left out the potato",2011-01-25
54550,1991003,5,1,I have put this soup into my new healthy menu rotation.  It is delicious.  I used beef broth cubes and cut the amount by 50% to help reduce the sodium level.  Thank you for sharing this healthful recipe!,2012-04-05
159265,131126,5,1,"I liked this one and thought the curry powder worked well on butternut squash.  I used Femmes' Revenge Caribbean Curry Mix Recipe #158082 I also didn't bother with threading on skewers.  I served right out of the oven.  Thanks Sharon!!! 
",2006-06-20
159265,67656,4,1,"These were quite good. I replaced the butter with olive oil (same fat but less cholesterol), and reduced it to about 2 tablespoons. Also added a bit  (1/2 teaspoon maybe) of garam masala. Really liked the way the spices contrasted with the natural sweetness of the squash. These would be a great way to get some veggies on the menu at a party dominated by finger foods. I think next time I might include sweet onions and red peppers to add a little more dimension and color to the dish. Thanks Sharon.",2006-06-24

Wonderful, wonderful dish!",2009-09-25
401631,14410,4,1,"Tried as written...mixed eggs into rice and cooked together. Made a congealed mass that looked bad but tasted good. Next time, tried cooking the eggs first to a soft scramble, then removing and adding rice to the pan. Heated rice, added egg and remaining ingredients. Daughter doesn't like hot sauce, asked for soy sauce instead and liked it very much in her thermos for school lunch. We'll definitely make this again. Final note...cheese seems unecessary, just made it more gluey.",2009-12-05
401631,2002238605,0,0,"I agree with you about mixing eggs raw into the rice. Rice comes out too gooey. My Mom made it for breakfast when there was left over rice. That was sixty years ago when you really pinched pennies but it was so good I thought my family had extra money that week and we were having a &quot;gourmet&quot; breakfast. LOL. No need for the cheese either, just salt and pepper. I love it till this day and so will anyone with a bunch of younguns trying to make ends meet.

15574,52176,5,1,"I made this for a visit from my brother and his grown son and they really enjoyed them.  I made one adaption. I used my food processor and chopped the celery and onions into the meat mixture. Then I added the rice by hand.  It was very easy preparation.  It is kind of like cabbage rolls without the cabbage.  I served with perogies and vegetables.  I really enjoyed the leftovers, too.  I will definitely make again.",2002-10-25
15574,746881,5,1,My husband and children LOVED this and so did I. I am my own worst critic and don't usually LOVE what I make but these were outstanding!! Thank you for the recipe I will be making this often. Very simple to make. I also finely chopped the celery and onion in my food processor then added it to the beef with the other ingredients and added about 1 tsp of Worcestershire Sauce to the tomato soup just because.

I like my pumpkin bread a little spicier and a little nuttier.  It also came out lighter than most breads, almost like a cake.  Followed the recipe to a ""T"", so I guess it's just a matter of taste!  Would definitely appeal to people who enjoy a lighter bread.  Thanks for posting.",2004-11-17

I used whole wheat pastry flour (and 2 tbsp. of buckwheat flour because I was out of the whole wheat pastry or white) and sucanat (organic unrefined can sugar) so mine came out very brown (which is why I didn't take a picture).  It has lovely flavor though, from the applesauce and oklahoma pecans.  I liked the strudel topping quite a bit.  Mine was crumbly but since I'm not sure if that was because of my subs.

279030,860893,4,1,"Good flavor.  I used a mango ginger chutney and red wine vinegar.  I added lots of minced garlic to the onions becuase my family loves garlic.  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed and some tumeric instead of pepper.  With 88% lean beef, half the butter was plenty.  Since I had extra time for the first part, I used more beef stock and added the tomato sauce to the meat and let it simmer longer before I started on the second saucepan (omitting the tomato sauce).

I used a 7 x 11 brownie pan, and made half the frosting recipe, made the frosting too soft so next time I will make firmer, so that it will be the same firmness as the bars.

One thing I had to do different:
I was using frozen blueberries I had recently frozen from fresh ones, so I would add the butter to the hot berries, not the cold (if you are using frozen), as the butter was not melting (had to put the whole thing into microwave to get the butter to melt, after mixing it all together...even with those changes, I still give it 5 stars...thanks Pastryismybiz!

A few changes I made to the recipe were, when adding the sugar to the pan, with 1 cup blueberries, I added 3 tablespoons of water with fear that if not the sugar would burn. Secondly, I added 2-3 extra tea spoons of corn starch after I let it boil the first time,  because I added a little more water. Thirdly, I added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice instead of lemon peel. This change made the pie, the slightly sour taste from the pie, with the spices and the sweetness of the sugar and blueberries made the pie. Lastly I added a little bit more spices then the recipe called for. The pie filling was amazing, and made my pie.

146129,141293,5,1,Wonderful comfort food.  Followed the recipe exactly until I realize I put in 2 cups of cheese.  As a result I had to thin out with a little more cream.  I cut the turkey into bite sized pieces and steamed broccoli and stirred them both into the sauce.  Serve with an Italian bread that was warm from the oven at the grocery store. YUMMY. ,2006-03-23
146129,165623,5,1,Very good - especially with leftovers. I had to make a few changes based on the picky eaters here. I cooked it as directed but before adding the cheese I used the immersion blender and whipped it up to hide the onions. This made for a great smooth sauce. I also had to change the cheese to colby jack. I added some pepper and seasoning salt. We really liked this - even the kids who don't like onions. I did have quite a bit of sauce leftover. Thanks I will be making this again,2009-11-29

I used a chili pepper infused olive oil to saute the shrimp in and next time I will double the amount of the hot red pepper flakes just because we would have liked a bit more of a bite to it.   Our guest who isn't used to hot spice love it just the way it was.  We find the pepper flakes help balance the sweetness of the garlic.

I had to make a few changes though: used stock instead of wine and added in some lemon juice, didn't have enough fresh parsley so added in some dried as well and used tagliatelle instead of angel-hair pasta, and I added in an extra generous pinch of red pepper flakes.

Did not add salt because I tossed in a couple of handfuls of Parmesan cheese to bring sauce together and that was plenty salty.  I would advise adding pasta to the saute pan with the sauce and shrimp and cooking over very low heat to allow the pasta to absorb the sauce. I must be a wimp because I could not get the garlic through the press with the peel on so I just threw it in whole and fished it out before serving.

55989,117781,5,1,"I have made these twice now and they are awesome! I have always had a hard time eating sweet potatoes because traditionally they are made into a sweet side dish with marshmallows or brown sugar or something of the like, which I have never cared for. This however, is the perfect way to serve sweet potatoes in my and my family's opinion. The savory paprika and garlic compliment the sweetness of the potato perfectly and provides a much healthier alternative to your standard baked potato or sweet potato souffle. I have made these twice and they really are to die-for. The second time I made them I added some chili powder and kosher salt which was even better. I used quite a bit more paprika and garlic as well to suit my family's taste.  I had a sublime accidental discovery in that I made these originally to serve along side Derf's Marinated Flank Steak with Mustard Sauce #12041, and found that the mustard sauce made the MOST INCREDIBLE dipping sauce for these sweet potato sticks since I used creole mustard in the sauce. Everything complimented each other so well that I will make that sauce just for these sweet potatoes each time I make them, not that they need anything extra, just in my family's opinion it made for the perfect side dish, especially for Phase 2 of the South beach diet!

This is EXACTLY the same ingredients that Mike Mills uses in his ""magic dust"" for a multitude of recipes & keeps on every table at the 17th Street Bar & Grill. It is the MOST STOLEN item from his restaurant according to Mike in his book ""Peace, Love, & Barbeque."" Heat and spice can be adjusted by varying the mustard and black pepper to taste... I recommend keeping amounts the same (whether doubling or halving) for each to retain ""balance"" of the overall blend... but I've finally settled on the original version for my tastes. <br/><br/>This dust is excellent as a rub for ribs/pork (and other meats). The ""dust"" is versatile; it is used in 17th Street's Tangy Pit Beans, Judy Mill's From-Scratch Baked Beans (humorous book revelation about these), & 17th Street's Becky's Deep Dish BBQ Pie as well as many other uses. Think of it as an alternative to paprika whenever called for... like to dust deviled eggs. I seldom make any kind of baked bean recipe anymore without adding a little magic dust! No canned baked beans or pork-n-beans I throw together ever gets to the table without a shot of magic dust!<br/><br/>As Mike says... keeps indefinitely in a tightly covered container, but it won't last long! This is a great item to keep near the grill or stove... or on the spice carousel.

Browning the meat was a very important step.  I did the cabbage for only the last 20 minutes, because I like it a little crisp.  The problem was really the sauce reduction.  It looked gorgeous and brown and thick and we thought it would be perfect, but the sauce was so salty it was unedible.  We just didn't eat it and talked a lot about how to fix it, but there really was no way without adding more liquid which would have ruined the sauce.  I just think the reduction with the corned beef caused the salt to become concentrated.  The veggies and meat did not taste salty, so we think it was some fluke.  Doesn't matter, I'd certainly make this again, but just remember to taste the sauce before serving ;-)",2005-03-18

The sauce reduction was a beautiful rich dark brown, looked perfect, smelled perfect, and I was looking forward to trying it -- but it was incredibly salty.

I did rinse it (the brisket) yesterday and put it in a Ziplok with water and put it in the fridge overnight. So, I had no problem of it being too salty. But, this was wonderful

The 2nd most important part is the combination of spices.  I would have never thought to put cinnamon, cloves or allspice on corned beef, but believe me it works!  After browning the meat, I put it in the crockpot with onions, garlic & spices on the bottom.  I add cabbage, carrots & potatoes closer to the end (last hour or so) so they are cooked, but not mush.  We're usually anxious to eat it when it's done (it smells so good) that I don't reduce the sauce.  Sometimes I omit the potatoes and just serve over wide egg noodles.

* Cooked in Crock Pot for 7 hours. 1st and last hours on HIGH - added potatoes & carrots at halfway point. 
* Made as directed with 1 extra Guiness, which I wouldn't recommend 
* I steamed cabbage in 1"" water covered on the stovetop until color started to fade. Added butter and salt.

86868,131510,5,1,I have been making corned beef for years and this was without a doubt the best.  I cooked it in the slow cooker. The vegtables came out a bit dark in color but it didn't bother us at all.  They tasted great!,2008-03-24

I didn't have the problem with salty sauce . . . in fact my sauce was a little bland, had to add some more salt . . . could be due to the brand of corned beef, maybe?

86868,819157,5,1,"This was amazing.  I made it in the crock pot, 2 1/2 lbs for 5 1/2 hours.  It was so tender!!  I added the potatoes and carrots at the beginning, but steamed the cabbage separate.  I then added the cabbage just before serving, so it could pick up some of the flavor.  I will never use another recipe, and can't think of a single change to make for this recipe.",2008-04-26
86868,602448,5,1,"Wow!  Awesome recipe.  I didn't have ground clove so I used about 5 whole cloves instead.  I also didn't have guinness, so I used 3 bottles of fat tire.  I only used 2 large white potatoes, skins on and diced large because I decided to use my cabbage in Recipe #73278.   My sauce had reduced a bit too much and was salty so I diluted it with water and then added some cornstarch like another reviewer.  I'm sure this would be awesome with the appropriate veg mix too, but it was great without them.",2008-05-16

I use a huge pot so doubled the
Guiness, spices and onions.

colour and texture.

86868,242856,5,1,"Great recipe!!  I have made it twice now and we love it!  I have not gotten brave enough to add the spices because I am a little wary having veggies flavored with them.  At 2 1/2 hours, I added some chopped cilantro with the carrots and potatoes and then added the cabbage 10 minutes later.  By 3 hours everything was perfect.  We always add a little rice wine vinegar when eating the cabbage and some horseradish with the meat.  All those flavors kind of blended on the plate and it was delicious!!  Next time I am going to take out some of the broth, add a little vinegar and horseradish and maybe thicken it with some cornstarch for the sauce.  Thanks for the best corned beef ever!!",2009-01-12
86868,1128874,5,1,"Yum!!  A very flavorful version of a classic dinner.  I reduced the sauce and added it over the meat before serving. It did keep the meat moist, but it does not refridgerate well so it wouldn't work for leftovers.  Still, a really great recipe.",2009-03-02

86868,841067,1,0,"I was excited with this recipe after reading everyone's great review, however my dish turned out very bitter. Perhaps it's supposed to be bitter due to using Guiness Stout as the recipe called for.  I had to neutralize it with lemon juice, orange juice, and sugar. Don't think I will ever use Guiness Stout in cooking corn beef in the future. ps: I bought Guiness Extra Stout, and realized there is also another type called Guiness Draught. Maybe that explains why it's too bitter. On the bright side, the corn beef did turned out fork tender, but most of it's flavor was lost in the bitter sauce. You have a very easy to follow instructions but this recipe is not for me. Thanks for sharing anyway.",2009-03-12

The recipe called for Guinness draught, not stout.  That's why your dish turned out bitter.  You misread one of the steps but don't let that stop you from cooking with Guinness!",2009-03-15
86868,806478,5,1,"This recipe was awesome. There was 5 of us and not much left to prove it. I used 1 flat cut and 2 point cuts. They weighed about 8lbs altogether. The most important part of this recipe is to brown the corned beef. What a great flavor it brings to the meat. I used 1 12oz. bottle of Guiness draught, but you could use more if you like. The only othere thing I did was to add about 3-4 tablespoons of red wine vinegar to the water and beer. I usually let my corned beef sit in some water and vinegar overnight in the frig to help cut some of the fat. But adding it to the cooking water was perfect. I used a counter top roaster oven for about 4 hours. You can take the meat out and cook the veggies in the roaster or pour the liquid into a large pot carefully and cook on the stove. The only thing I didn't do was make the sauce. No one missed it. But next time I'll try it. This will be made more than on St Pat's Day. Thanks for the recipe!",2009-03-16
86868,1147992,5,1,"This recipe is the best corned beef and cabbage I have tried. I used a 3-1/2 lb ""first cut"" - not sure what that is, but it was the only kind the store had. After browning, I put it in my slo cooker on top of the onion and garlic. When 1 bottle of Guinness draught did not cover the brisket, I added another at the suggestion of my husband. Then added the bayleaf and spices. I let it cook on med hi for 3 hours, then added the cabbage wedges and carrots, which were cooked after 40 minutes. The time probably depends on your slo cooker. (We made Colcannon separately so did not add potatoes.) It was a big success - even picky kids ate it - ""Oh, good, ham!"" The older one had an ""Irish ham"" sandwich the next day! We did not make the sauce, the meat was just right as far as salt content.",2009-03-17

I did use the stout, but did not like the flavor of the broth and, therefore did not reduce and intensify it.  Maybe it was just too salty for me.

My meat was only 2 lbs and was cooked perfectly after 2 hours. I'm not a lover of Guinness but the flavor wasn't overwhelming at all. I didn't have any cloves but I threw in the little seasoning packet that came with the meat and some salt for extra flavor. The house smelled amazing. I will definitely make this again.,2009-03-19

Corned beef seared all sides, fatty part on bottom then put in crockpot.  Smallest red potatoes I could find, leaving most skin, removing eyes.  Carrots peeled and in 3rds.  Cabbage in quarters with stem holding together.  Used spice if comes with corned beef or whole peppercorns, bay leaves, and combo of onion powder, whole cloves, garlic powder, and cinnamon.  Added whole peeled garlic and onion if I could fit (threw away after, for flavor only).  Add Guinness draught and water to fill rest.  Crockpot on low for 10 hours.

86868,693345,5,1,"Super awesome. I've never made corned beef before, but my mom always used to make it in the crock pot, so that's what I did. My husband said the meat and potatoes were really good (and he is not even a big fan of potatoes!). I used a 3 1/2 lb corned beef brisket, a 14.9 oz. can of Guinness Draught (plus extra water to cover meat), 5 red potatoes (quartered), 1 lb. bag baby carrots, 2 1/2-3 Tablespoons minced garlic from the jar, and 2 Tablespoons minced onion flakes (because an onion wouldn't fit into my 5 qt. crock pot with everything else-it was packed!). I cooked it for about 9 hours on low. I was going to put the cabbage in 40 or 50 min. before serving, but it wouldn't have fit, so I took Tia Mouse's suggestion and steamed the cabbage on the stovetop before serving dinner (Recipe #100781). As I was putting the spices in, I knew it would be tasty. I served this with Recipe #360988 and green and white Recipe #186726 for an awesome St. Patrick's Day meal.

184764,1983673,1,0,"HORRIBLE!<br/><br/>My boyfriend and I worked together on this recipe, and this was our experience:<br/><br/>This recipe was very disappointing. We were skeptical when the recipe told us to add the lemon & herb mixture to 2 cups of water, and with good reason: we ended up with a watery broth that the recipe was instructing us to pour over the fish - which didn't make sense to us at all. We felt it would have made more sense to cook the fish in the broth rather than pour it over top.<br/><br/>So we tried it.<br/><br/>The problem is: we tasted the broth, while the fish was boiling in it, and it tasted horrible! Needless to say we did our best to salvage the fish before it could be completely tainted. The flavors of the garlic, lemon and herbs did not compliment each other.<br/><br/>Take one bad taste, add a set of ambiguous instructions and one spoiled dinner: and you get a recipe we will never attempt or recommend ever again.<br/><br/>Take our advice: stay away from this recipe!",2011-08-15

Next time, I think I will cut back the peanut butter chips to 1 cup though instead of the 2 that I added this time.

I added some mini-yogurt chips to some, and carob chips to others (would've done chocolate, but my kids were too hyper already). They were good, but probably not necessary nor as yummy as the PB chips would have been.

One hint.  For something a bit different, add a couple of chopped or whole peanuts to the top of each cookie before baking.  :)

Recipie does freeze extremely well, and can even be frozen on trays as if you were going to bake them immediately then bagged in ziploc bags as soon as they are hard for super convenient cooking. (A little trick I learned from working at a bakery.)",2007-05-17

I love this fruit dip with bananas and strawberries!! SO good!!

287010,311003,5,1,"This is so easy and tastes so terrific.  I served it to my family with mixed fresh fruit, and they loved it.  It was great to see everyone enjoying something besides chips, etc.  The dip is a perfect combination; not too sweet because of the cream cheese.  I might add more Cool Whip next time to make it softer and easier to cover the fruit with a lot of the dip (that's how much we all liked it).  It would be perfect to serve to company either before a meal, or after, because it's light and refreshing.  Thanks for posting this great recipe!!",2008-11-15
287010,422893,5,1,"After seeing Tastetester's photo, I just had to make this. I made for my toddler's playgroup & the kids loved dipping their fruit in it.

186945,923043,5,1,This is truly amazing stuff--definitely a case where the sum is greater than the parts. We like it with more salt (up to 4 teaspoons) since we serve it over rice as a main dish. I've made it with and without the wine--good either way.,2009-10-13

22803,288704,5,1,"Delicious recipe :). Eventhough mine came out more like a cake than cookie bars. I used fresh pineapple, added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 cup of mixed nuts (walnut, cashew & almond). I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup. I baked it for 30 mins and I didn't add anything else (powdered sugar or the pineapple frosting that recommended by Domestic Goddess). I will definetely make this again, and maybe I will reduce the sugar even more (because it was still kind of too sweet for me). Also next time, I will definetely do it with the frosting aswell. I bet it will taste even better. ",2006-05-15

He's not big on most sweets, asked me to make another batch..he's loving them! They were a bit to ""cakey"" for me, but flavor is great! Easy to make. DH would give them a 15",2007-03-27
22803,59686,5,1,"These bars were good, but even better when frosted with a Pineapple Cream Cheese Frosting, which I posted in my review.  I found the bars were done when I baked them for exactly 27 minutes.  I think if you bake them 45 minutes, (as suggested) they'll burn. Here's my recipe for the Pineapple Cream Cheese Frosting: 4 ounces cream cheese, (softened) 2 Tablespoons butter, (softened) 2 Tablespoons of pineapple juice, (that you can use from the 20 ounce can in the bar recipe) 3 cups powdered sugar, and 3-4 Tablespoons of chopped walnuts.  Mix the cream cheese, butter, 
pineapple juice and powdered sugar thoroughly. Frost cooled bars, and sprinkle with the chopped walnuts. P.S. I also added a 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the bar recipe as well. Beve, with these bars frosted, I give this recipe 5 STARS.  Thank you for the recipe Beve!!",2008-01-03

I found this recipe with the exact same ingredients, including UNSPECIFIED &quot;nuts&quot;!!  I chose pecans but suspect she used Walnuts.  I also used a small pan that she used but next time, will definitely try 9x13 pan.  The smaller pan made a coffee cake type confection, rather than a bar cookie,  still delicious! But the center was a bit al dente (still delicious!).  Will definitely make it again.",2015-04-04

Just the way I like it.",2003-09-24

71258,321879,5,1,"The texture of this is amazingly rich and perfect.  Being vegetarian I used veg stock and added a bit of crushed red pepper with the nutmeg (we like everything spicy!). I left out the spinach as we had none, but I can't wait to make this again with other veggies. Oh, and I added a clove of garlic with the onions and baked this in my corningware casserole (after starting it in a saucepan). Thanks for a great recipe that is going into my permanent files!",2008-03-15
71258,169430,5,1,I made it a *bit* lighter by skipping the sautÃ©ing in oil. I just started with the stock and added the rice and onion to that. Aside from that I followed the directions and got a delightful risotto. This method of making the classic rice dish in the oven work's perfectly. There's no need for all that stirring. I love this way of making it. Made for ZWT4.,2008-06-04

I will definitely make this again.",2008-06-09

71258,226788,5,1,"The best risotto I've ever made.  It turns out perfectly every time without needing to stand over it carefully adding broth.  You can actually walk away from it and do something else while it's cooking and it will still turn out perfect!  For risotto, that's like a miracle.  Make sure you use thin stalks of asparagus in this.  I also add the juice of one lemon to the last round of baking.",2008-11-30
71258,55523,5,1,"What a phenomenal risotto!  I was a bit sceptical about a baked risotto, but it turned out lovely.  I doubled the recipe (Thank God) and somehow forgot the spinach.

71258,245429,5,1,"Delicious!! I used a 12"" iron skillet and halved the recipe.  I also used 3 minced cloves of garlic as others suggested.

I replaced the spinach with collard greens and added 2 minced cloves of garlic to the  onion sautee to add to the flavor of the collards. I also replaced the chicken broth with vegetable broth.  The flavor was terrific!!  We are looking forward to having this recipe again!",2012-05-13

284687,39795,5,1,"This bread turned out great, it's a HUGE improvement over the original no-knead that went around awhile ago. The dough is firmer and easier to work with. The parchment trick makes it very easy to shape and get in the pot. I used my 5 quart crock pot liner and glass lid to bake, worked fine.

284687,316094,5,1,"I agree with Monstr - this turns out SO much better than the regular no-kneads!  I followed the original ATK instructions (3/4 c. water, 1/2 c. beer) but increased the yeast to 1/2 t. since I only had regular yeast.  For baking I used a 10-inch cast iron pot with 3 1/2--inch sides.  The loaf rose so much that it hit the lid!  It turned out with a beautiful super-crispy crust and looked just like the artisanal loaves I see at the store!  My loaf was already golden brown when I took the lid off after 30 minutes so another 15 was all that was needed to produce a deep brown crust.  I was so impressed I just bought a bigger cast iron pot on Amazon so my future loaves have as much room as they need.  Excellent!!",2009-04-26

I used goose liver pate (normal goose liver pate, not foie gras, so it wasn&#039;t so much more expensive than the chicken) because they didn&#039;t have a chicken one that I know I like.  I also made extra sauce to use up the mushrooms from the rest of the recipe and to make sure I didn&#039;t need a side dish to save me some work.  I will try it again with roe deer because I think the recipe would also be well suited to roe deer as well.  Thanks for sharing!",2014-01-01

They were great and had the advantage of cooking up in just 22 minutes.  I reduced the oil by a third which made the ancho paste a little thicker but the taters were still crispy and had that lovely sweet spicy kick.  Betting this would work well on sweet potatoes and plan to try that soon. Made for ZWT3.,2007-07-08

I used 1/4 cup organic rolled oats and 1/4 cup organic wheat bran and 2 Tbs (1/8c) wheat germ for one serving (3.75 servings according to the recipe).  I am not sure why you would need 9 cups of water for this, either.  I used one cup for my quarter recipe, and felt it was plenty.  Other than that, I think this is a good recipe- I like that it is very versatile and so healthy and can go sweet or savory (like Upma  #75504).  I drizzled mine with honey and milk and sprinkled with a few drops of orange blossom water.  Verstile healthy breakfast and a nice change from plain ol' oatmeal.  ",2004-11-19

I cooked the carrots & parsnips and arranged them in a baking dish - mixed the Olive oil, fennel seeds, coriander, cinnamon & garlic then spread this mixture over the veggies.covered the dish with foil and refrigerated it until 45 minutes before dinner.   I mixed the cilantro, lemon peel & lemon juice & extra 1 tbsp oil together-covered and set it aside. I did all of this in the morning , . Popped it in a 350 oven, foil covered. Baked for 30 minutes, removed the foil and sprinkled the coriander mixture over the veggies - back into the oven for apprx 15 minutes 6"" from the broiler and the vegetables browned nicely.  Love this dish thanks Sharon123 for posting Hope you don't mind that I cooked it a little differently",2006-08-29
159863,220348,5,1,"These were really good, I enjoyed them alot. I like the blend of lemon juice and peel with the spices. I used two large garlic cloves instead of five, but I wished I had put another one in there.",2007-11-15
159863,107583,5,1,"What a nice blend of flavors!  Went very well with a roast goose for Christmas dinner.  I overcooked the parsnips in step one, but they were still tasty!",2007-12-25
159863,293410,5,1,"As past reviewers have said, the blend of flavors in this dish is fantastic. I used regular carrots, quartered, and sprinkled each serving with coarse salt. Delish. But whaddya mean, ten servings- as a side dish we got six out of it! This is a keeper!",2008-04-20
159863,187927,5,1,"Loved this! I'd never tried parsnips before, so this was a wonderful way to introduce a new veggie into my diet. I needed to make this a truly ""make-ahead"" dish, so I followed the method that Bergy shared in her review, but otherwise made as directed for the most part; I used the coriander but had to do without the cilantro (had none), and used dried ornage peel instead of the fresh lemon peel. In spite of boiling the parsnips a little too long, this came out *just* right... GREAT flavors! As it was baking in my oven, my roomie couldn't get over how wonderful it smelled. I had NO leftovers, even though I made the full recipe and there were only 5 of us at dinner. :) Thanks for sharing!",2008-12-21

Although I had round steak, I thought I would use this as a change. What a great change this was, too! I didn't have any onion soup mix, so I used a can of *Campbells French Onion* soup and eliminated the extra water. I had some grand egg noodles and served some of the mushrooms mixed into the noodles too. Lovely with many thanks breezermom! Made for *Everyday is a Holiday* Dec 2008",2008-12-14

I started it a little before DH was home from work thinking it would be done when he got home...needless to say i was calling him because dinner was ready and he was still driving home.  Only change I made was to quarter the mushrooms so they would be big enough for DH to pick them out.  This has a really great flavor; served over egg noodles.  Next time I think I will add a little milk to the sauce to thin it out so it has more 'gravy' for the noodles.  Made for 1-2-3-Hits January 2010.",2010-02-01

My husband loved it, and I went back and ate more out of the pan! :-) I started the recipe and quickly realized that I had used the last of my onion, so I substituted one cup of green squash.

I jazzed it up with a more interesting glaze, but you can do whatever you want for that (I add 2 heaping tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tbsp lemon juice, and 1/2 tsp mustard powder to the 1/4 cup ketchup).

This was supposed to produce a crumbly dough...mine was very sticky and I had to add a lot more flour to get it to form a dough at all.  When they came out of the oven they were more doughy/bready than the crunch of Biscotti.  The taste wasn't bad but it wasn't my favorite.  Unfortunately I wouldn't make this again.",2009-08-21
279790,532179,5,1,"I thought this was very true to the recipe... my dough was indeed crumbly in texture (unlike how another person stated).  I did NOT use a mixer (maybe she did?) and just stirred the dry and wet together and kneaded by hand incorporating more and more of the little flour crumbles.  Eventually it WAS a sticky log on my cookie sheet, but it was ready to bake so no worries!  I found the baking time to be right if you like a softer chewier biscotti, but to produce a more authentic hard and crunchy biscotti I sliced after the initial baking time and then baked for 30 minutes on each side.  This produced super crunchy biscotti with a really nice mild pumpkin flavor.  I was guessing at the ""pinch"" size, and probably added a bit more clove and ginger than called for but it made for a really tasty cookie.

Thanks for posting!",2009-06-18

I quartered the recipe just in case we did not care for it, but I see that was a mistake :)  I ""rubbed"" about 4 lbs. of steak and still have some left.  This was much easier than marinating and the flavor is subtle, but delicious.  You can definately taste the cayenne...adds a bit of heat, but not TOO much.

30949,31261,5,1,"This is absolutely the best barbecue dry rub I have found to so far!  What I like about it so much that it has a Wonderful taste and seems to make the meat really tender and keeps it juicy.  This recipe actually reminds me of an Emeril Live show in the fact that this recipe tastes “kicked up a notch” that it’s so good.
To start with I made it just as the recipe said and it was really good, definitely a 5 star recipe in quality, maybe just a bit saltier than we like, and just slightly more sweeter than we’d ideally like, just our personal preference. I really  love it that it seems to bring out the best of the flavor of whatever meat you use it on.  What I’ve found through trial and error has worked best for us is to use1/3 cup less sugar (1-2/3 cups sugar), and half the salt (1/4 cup).  For those who like more salt (like my husband, I don’t) you can always add more salt later.  
My very favorite thing to use it on is the frozen 4 lb. re-sealable bags of frozen chicken wings.  I take the chicken wings out of the freezer, put them on the “auto defrost” cycle on the microwave just long enough to get them partially thawed, which makes them wet enough for the dry rub to cling to the chicken.  Then I put the dry rub (not the whole recipe, probably about ½ to 3/4 of it) in the bag with the chicken, seal it, and shake it to coat all the wings. Then I let the wings marinate in the dry rub overnight.  The wings are partially thawed so it ”looks” like there’s about a whole bottle of barbecue sauce on the wings, which the liquid helps it marinate.  Then the leftover dry rub I like to sprinkle on the chicken when grilling on the barbecue (if I think  it needs more dry rub); if it doesn’t then I store the “extra” for the next time I need a great barbecue rub.  This recipe also works well in the oven.  
We do eat a lot of onions, and like the onion flavor in a barbecue sauce, so sometimes I add a tsp. of onion powder to the basic recipe.
Bottom line, all in all, this is one of our very favorite recipes, and I’d recommend it highly, as we use it often, especially in the summer when it’s nice weather  to grill. out ;)

I was looking for a rub that didn't include a gazillion spices, because I wanted something simple that I could tailor if I wanted a specific flavor.  After reading other comments, I did cut the salt in half since I don't like very salty food (and used half coarse sea salt and half regular sea salt).  I also reduced the sugar by 1/3 and made it half white and half turbinado.   I used about a quarter of the recipe on a half rack of ribs -- tossed the rub and ribs in a plastic bag and let it sit in the fridge overnight.

212681,156783,5,1,"I had to tweak the recipe a bit given what I had in my pantry.  I marinated my shrimp in equal amounts of Italian dressing and balsamic vinegar; used stewed tomatoes and 1 tsp dried basil, and spaghetti instead of fettuccine.  We didn't put the parmesan on top because it just didn't need it - it was wonderful as it was.  Even my toddler enjoyed this one!  We'll definitely be making this again.",2007-12-18
212681,29196,5,1,"This was amazing tonight thanks Paula. We are currently travelling in what Australians call &quot;the outback&quot; so we have to use what we can get. We bought 5kg of prawns recently, but they are smaller than you wanted and we also had a thin spaghetti rather than fettuccini. I used a tablespoon of balsamic and one of oil for the vinaigrette  and regular vine ripened tomatoes. We love sauce, so I added in a quarter cup of pasta water at the end to extend the prawn, tomato, cream cheese  mix. This is one of those dishes I wish had never finished or I could eat again tomorrow.",2013-06-07
212681,742029,5,1,"This was fantastic! We doubled the recipe and used dried basil instead of fresh. We then had enough leftovers to have it for lunch the next day. To reheat, we started with the noodles and some of the sauce in a frying pan on medium. We added a little bit of half and half (1/8 c? maybe a little more) and another squirt or 2 of balsamic dressing to keep it moist. After the noodles were largely heated, we added the shrimp back in to avoid them turning to rubber. After a minute or two it was as delicious (maybe even more?) than the night before! Thank you for sharing this recipe! We will definitely have it again!",2017-11-05
59423,37449,5,1,These were so delicious!!! The flavors were great! I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I used Szechuan sauce instead. I served them with some homemade sweet and sour sauce I had on hand. I did leave out the chicken(personal preference). Thanks so much for a recipe I will make again!!!,2003-04-23
359125,724631,5,1,"Delicious, and safer, too!  It makes sense to cook the brats through before grilling for the sear marks; you know they have been cooked thoroughly.

I  used frozen broccoli that was very well drained as that's all I had on hand, and used flank steak cut very thin when it was partially frozen, that made for easier slicing, I used a lot more than 2 cloves of garlic however, I think mabey 1 heaping tablesoonful.  I served it with brown rice bakied in the oven in broth and onions, we enjoyed this very much, a wonderful quick weekday meal, thank you for sharing another winner!...Kitten:)",2004-12-16

81207,174854,4,1,This was an OK recipe. Made it a few nights ago. My mom said that the meat was delicious but for some reason the vegetable part just didnt taste that good. She said she is used to a beef and broccoli that was onions and other additions as opposed to just brocolli. I think that overall the recipe is good but it just wasnt what we were looking for. We ended up using the meat for sandwiches.,2005-01-21
81207,34280,5,1,"Thanks for this. From my 'extensive' cooking experience <wink> I knew that if I added 1/2 teaspoon baking soda to the soy/cornstarch mix, it would have that 'restauranty' taste. So I added 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, left out the salt to balance it a little, and added 1 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes and seeds and 1/4 cup orange marmalade. Viola, szechuan orange beef and broccoli. Boy is this a good basic recipe. Thanks!",2005-02-11
81207,27678,5,1,"A wonderfully easy dish to make. I used braising steak that had been marinating in a touch of lemon juice for about 15 minutes when I came across this recipe and it was wonderful. Surprisingly tender. Love the flavours in this and the fact it comes together so quickly. I used purple sprouting broccoli (a close cousin to the more common variety), because it is in season in the UK at the moment.",2005-04-14
81207,124249,4,1,"The only problem I had with this dish was when the directions said to put the water into the smoking oil. I didn't do that because  I was afraid it would be come a fountain of popping oil. Otherwise, this was a easy dish to prepare. I added water chestnuts and mushrooms and served it over steamed rice. 

Thanks Uncle Bill.

81207,187281,5,1,Excellent!  I did use precut stir-fry meat but otherwise followed the directions.  The method of cooking the beef really seems to keep the meat tender.  After making this it appears that I always overcooked stirfry beef.  Thanks!,2006-08-30

I followed the recipe exactly and it worked out wonderful.  I saved a little of the broccoli mixture for myself and stirfried it with some shrimp I had.  That was good too.

My only problem with the recipe is that I found there wasn't enough sauce (I like there to be enough sauce to cover the noodles). I added extra water, soy sauce, and oil but it still wasn't enough. 
I usually add red pepper flakes to most of my dishes but I found that it wasn't necessary - it tasted good as is.

I couldn't find the sambal oelek, but I had some garlic chili sauce in my fridge, and used that since that was closest to the description given.  And, I LOVED this.

Additionally, I'll use this method for meat in any and all future stir fry dishes I prepare... I used the tapioca starch vs cornstarch and got the benefit of succulent tender beef and the velvety mouth feel in the sauce that you normally get with take out!  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for some heat and next time will add brown sugar for a note of sweetness.  Finally, I'd like to speak to method particularly given some of the comments in the reviews... with the broccoli already in the wok, as per the instructions, I didn't find adding water to the pan to be either scary or dangerous ;)  TY for the best attempt at Chinese I've ever made in my own kitchen!",2010-04-20

65861,1683962,4,1,"Delicious! Very easy and forgiving too. I didn't have rosemary so I used a little basil and thyme. I accidentally did a tbsp instead of modifying to a tsp. for dried, so that explains why there was so much spice, but it actually still came out really great! I will make this again for sure.<br/><br/>At first it seemed like the garlic burned in the oil, maybe I had the heat too high, but the flavor was really perfect. It gave a pleasant roasted taste even though it was pan fried.<br/><br/>I used frozen broccoli because that's what I had...I thought the texture came out perfect. Still enough moisture, crunch, and not soggy or overcooked at all.",2013-01-23

Even with only 2 cups of broccoli on hand, the blend of the two main ingredients came out fine. I also threw in a handful of sunflower seeds and a splash of mystery veggie sauce (leftover from a friend's meal delivery kit), based on reports of blandness by other reviewers, but I don't think that was necessary. I think it would be worthwhile trying out an herb other than rosemary in this recipe.",2018-10-18

We'd never had bread salad before, so I don't really know if we're just not big on bread salad in general or if this didn't turn out right for me. The flavor was good, but everything but the celery was just kind of wilty and soggy. I know the recipe said the lettuce would wilt a bit, but it wilted a lot. I'd use something else instead of lettuce if I were to make this again. I think it would be better with broccoli and cauliflower florets. I'd also make sure to get the bread really really well toasted before it goes into the dressing. I sauteed the bread for 10 minutes over medium heat and that doesn't seem to have been long enough.

DH liked them better than my standing recipe.  The gravy was good but DH preferred our regular gravy.  It is the first time I have ever used a gravy mix so maybe that was it.  Excellent meal and I will defnitely be fixing my cube steaks like this in the future.  Thanks TasteTester.  Made for  teammate  for the 12 Days of Christmas.,2008-12-10
33192,35965,4,1,"This looked lovely, but the chocolate was over-powering.  I used a regular graham cracker crust rather than a chocolate graham cracker crust, so initially I thought I was the only one who would feel the chocolate over-powered the cherries.  Unfortunately, everyone complained that the chocolate was 'too' strong.  I think I'll try it again, but reduce the chocolate chips to about half or replace semi-sweet with milk chocolate.

For those who haven't mastered how to dice a mango, it might be messy.  (My secret is to cut the mango with the skin into four slices around the seed, and then dice it on the peel then scrape the diced fruit off the peel).  It was so easy after the chopping, just simmer and cool.  Looks colorful and fancy too, I may try and   take a picture..  I did add a little salt.",2011-06-11

330856,1621875,5,1,This is a quick easy meal.  You can use fresh broccoli (steamed) in the recipe as well.  I also used a cream of chicken soup and a cream of broccoli.  Very nice.  It is definitely a keeper.  We are thinking you could take the mixture and make it into a casserole as well.  Sub any veggie or add more.  Very filling too.,2010-05-30

I used No Yolks noodles and the dish seemed a little heavy on pasta, not very saucy, and it seemed hard to discern the stroganoff flavors.

301877,67728,5,1,"Made these the other night for DH's dinner, and I must say, these were wonderful! Delicious, and super-easy to make, too! I was too lazy to rehydrate my dried shiitakes, so I just cut up a couple of portabella caps I had in my fridge begging to be used. I found that the added salt was unneccessary because the chorizo I used (Gaspar's Portuguese Hot Chourico) made the mixture salty enough by itself. Unfortunately, I was too short on time to make roasted tomatillo salsa this time around, so I served them with some Herdez 5 Chiles salsa instead. I know that DH will be asking for these again, so next time I'll have to try them with the correct salsa. Good Job, moobaby ;)! Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 09",2009-03-28

I live where there is snow, so out they went for an hour instead of the freezer!  I then broke the ""candy"" into bite size pieces.  Much easier than trying to cut out each saltine!

Instead of boiling on the stovetop for 1 minute and then pouring on the crackers and bake for 7 minutes, I&#039;ve always boiled on the stovetop for 3 minutes and then baked for 5. I doubt it really matter which way you do it, but what DOES matter is that the butter/sugar mixture actually BOILS for 6-8 minutes so don&#039;t count the part where everything is still melting together as part of your cooking time. If it doesn&#039;t cook long enough your toffee will turn out with a little bit of softness/chewiness instead of being crisp. I line my jelly roll pan with foil and then lightly spray with cooking oil so they&#039;re super easy to get out.

381369,690623,4,1,I made this recipe twice.  The first time I halved it and I must have done something wrong because while the flavour was great the rice didn't get cooked properly.  Last might I made it again using the full recipe and checked it after 1 hour.  The rice was still quit hard so I added another 1/2 of broth and nuked it for 5 minutes before putting it back in the over to get a bit of a crust.  Perfect!  <br/>I'm giving this a four for the great taste and ease of prep and cooking.  When I make it again I would add an addition cup of liquid from the start.

I had been saving a can of artichoke hearts someone had given me, waiting to find the right recipe, and this was the right one! My husband and son loved it, too, and I know my husband doesn't even like artichokes. I used a garlic that I had broiled for 10 minutes and loved the aioli instead of mayo.

I worried this might end up too dry with no real added liquid, but the slow cook produced enough with the tomato and chicken in there.In an effort to reduce the fat, I just toasted 1 tablespoon of pine nuts and used them as a garnish to finish.

It takes longer than 5 minutes to just gather ingredients. 4) Saut&eacute; onion/garlic until onion is translucent or is browned? While I was comfortable guessing since exact measurements aren't critical, this recipe could be tough for a newbie cook or one unfamiliar with this type of food. I doubled the cumin, used one can of garbanzos (a little less than called for so we wouldn't have 3/4 of an open can left), and next time will double the tomatoes.

Its not a soup I would want often , but when I have it I would totally and completly enjoy it, even as unaccostomed to cherry flavour as I am. The only reason that I couldn't give this 5 stars is becuase my DH dislikes fruit, and dislikes warm fruit even more... so I will never be able to make this as part of a romantic dinner for two and if I made it for guests he would sit refusing to eat it, so I would need a second soup that he would eat.

I did think it was a little oily, but I'm sure that was my fault and not the recipe. I didn't have peanut oil and used olive oil instead, so that's what it could have been. GREAT recipe Bergy.",2012-04-28
11548,570625,5,1,This was great & easy to make.  Look forward to making more when my chard is ready to harvest in the garden.  I used red onion (about 1/4cup) in place of scallions; also used reduced-fat feta and didn't alter flavor at all.  Thanks!!,2012-10-21

I couldn't get my mom to make it with tomatoes because no one else liked it that way but me and grandpa, so grandma would make it when I stayed with them.  I love it!  This is a very rich and creamy dish, and the addition of the cayenne gives it a little snap! I only had 1 cup elbow mac on hand, so added 1 1/2 cup penne also.

I've never had mac and cheese with tomatoes before and I definitely didn't hate it :) Make sure to use sharp cheddar cheese as the flavor would have been lacking without it.

416412,59686,4,1,"Made this for last night's dinner, but hubby and I agreed this dish seemed to be missing something. Even though I added the cayenne pepper, I still added a few dashes of Tabasco Green Pepper Sauce to my serving on my plate, while my husband added regular Tabasco to his. We felt the Tabasco gave this dish a nice kick! I subbed 3 cups of Rotini pasta for the 2 cups of elbow macaroni, plus I subbed stewed tomatoes for the diced tomatoes, and I used 2% milk instead of the 1%. After I added the flour to the butter, I only needed to cook that for about 1 minute, then I gradually stiired in the milk and half-and-half, and cooked that for about 4 minutes to thicken up the sauce, to make it creamy, and for the lumps of flour to disapear. I then turned off the heat, and added the 3 cups of shredded cheese; stirring continuously til the cheese melted. In another saucepan, I heated the broth and stewed tomatoes along with the already cooked pasta for just a few minutes, then added that to the cheesy-creamy sauce in a 2-1/2 quart casserole baking dish, and baked the mac 'n' cheese for 22 minutes. This was a nice twist on mac 'n' cheese. Enjoyed the tomatoes in this dish, and enjoyed the aroma of the cheese after I took it out of the oven. It tasted ever so good when I reheated it in the microwave. Lori, I'm looking forward to making this again. Thanx for the recipe!!",2012-11-15

88243,130219,5,1,Only one word... delicious!! VERY easy to make. I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still plenty sweet. Thanks for a great cake recipe Rita.,2008-04-02
88243,58786,5,1,"I did this somewhat differently, but not enough to change the basic character of this excellent cake.
I didn't use cherries or pecans, but added a light sprinkling of unsweetened flaked coconut. I had pineapple in juice, so I wound up reducing the juice slightly with a little added sugar and a splash of lemon, because the pineapple really wasn't tart.
In the interests of overall reduced calories/saturated fat, I used Earth Balance buttery sticks for the butter in making the syrup for the pan, and used it again for the oil, but kept the 1/2 c measure even though I doubled the recipe. I did this with the sugar as well in the batter, but not the topping.
The overall result, tender, moist, light crumb--pineapple shows through in appearance and taste, but it's not overly sweet. I found it quite easy to make.
Oh, and for speed of combining, I melted my EB stick into the heated syrup reduction and added both to the flour mix, then stirred in the eggs. I didn't beat it a lot, but you could see it activate the baking powder. I spooned and spread the batter to cover. It's pretty too, even this simple.",2008-12-27

Did not have orange jello so my bavarian was raspberry served with a tablespoon of Cool Whip Free and a  couple of fresh blueberries.  Again simply delicious.

Because the bread is thinner than regular white bread...there was a small amount of egg mixture left over....but that's a good thing, even less saturated fat.

50495,607558,5,1,"I absolutely loved this recipe. It was so quick and easy and thick. I cooked the chicken in the 2 1/2 cups water and 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and then just added the rest of the ingredients, and followed directions except for biscuits. I made bisquick biscuits. So good though.  Will definitely make it again.",2009-09-14

50495,545487,5,1,"I love this recipe in it's original form, but have adapted it to our tastes to be a little heartier and healthier. We like more dumplings, so I make dumplings with Heart-Healthy Bisquick (equal to about 2 cans of biscuits). There's room even if it doesn't look like it since the dough fluffs up when you first add it, but then condenses after it cooks. I use 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom - both Healthy Request. I only use 2 cups of chicken.  I use 4 cups of low sodium chicken broth. And I add a little garlic powder and paprika along with the original amount of black pepper. Everyone who has ever tried it has loved it, and I don't feel as guilty eating it. Great recipe and easy too.",2010-03-14

Followed another reviewer's tip and used chicken broth in place of water, no bouillion, and just the can of chicken soup.  Let the biscuits simmer for 20 minutes and off the burner for 10.  DH was duly impressed, and I have some yummy comfort food for lunch.  Thanks, ratherbeswimmin' !",2010-07-03

I added some other herbs and spices and some cornstarch to thicken it up a little. My fiance and I don't have time to cook since we are in school and this was just perfect. I don't think you can tell the difference between the biscuits and homemade dumplings. Thank you so much for posting!",2010-10-20
50495,177933,4,1,"I thought the soup part of this was awesome. I did add a 1/2 cup white wine, a couple bay leaves and some onion powder. The biscuit dumplings were just okay for me. My husbands family is from the south and I have made their from scratch recipe and it takes so long, so I was hoping for a great short-cut in this and I think I've still found it in the broth and with a rotisserie chicken, but I'll have to make the dumplings from scratch. We're used to super thin dumplings and though these were good, the texture is so different. My husband hasn't come home yet, but I know he'll say they're too thick. Anyway, this is still a glowing review because the flavor of the soup was incredible! Thank you for posting!",2011-12-08

I've read all the reviews on this one and decided to send her this recipe and she said it tasted so good.  Because of that, I wanted to try it for myself; I made this tonight and I have to say, it was definitely EASY and DEEELISH!  I had to thicken it up a bit because it was a bit watery for me, but other than that, my family loved it!!

50495,246145,5,1,"This is how my mom always made chicken and dumplings. They're much easier and taste just as good as the homemade dumplings in most recipes. I've found that pulling the biscuits into tiny pieces tends to make them cook faster, and doesn't effect the taste or texture, unless you want them to be underdone. Otherwise 30 minutes isn't going to do it. And make sure that you stir them regularly. They will stick to the bottom and burn.",2013-03-11
50495,1926889,4,1,"So quick and easy!  Never thought dumplings could be a 20 minute dish.  The boyfriend loved them!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I uploaded a picture, if the coloring looks a little different than the others, it&#039;s because I chose to substitute beef stock instead of water, just as personal preference.  It blended great, and made the broth super rich (maybe a con to some, but we love rich broth). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I also added a little flour to thicken it up.  When I make dumplings from scratch, I always end up with thick broth, as loose flour tends to fall off the dumplings and thicken the surrounding broth.  The added flour mimicked this &quot;from scratch&quot; effect, and the boyfriend was none the wiser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;m still loyal to my grandma&#039;s backwoods Kentucky dumplings, but they&#039;re so time consuming.  Honestly, who can afford to spend an entire day cooking dinner?  Because of this, I&#039;ve pretty much eliminated dumplings from my day to day menu, but this recipe provided the perfect solution.  The shortcut was delicious, and far more practical than conventional dumplings.  I&#039;ll definitely be making them again.",2013-03-20

The Old Bay Seasoning (a Maryland tradition) is a must, and the fish sauce was perfect at 1 tablespoon. I used fresh oregano, basil, and marjoram and put it right into the marinade. These are great, and you will be happy you made this delightful, easy recipe. I poked these with pretty little toothpicks and dipped them into some cocktail sauce for a early dinner treat.

93387,80353,1,0,"I wish I could be more generous with this recipe, because the theory was sound - just didn't work in practice.  The brown rice provided a 'mustiness' that I think didn't work in this pudding, and after cooking, the buttermilk left a strange graininess in the mouth.  I found that I really had to watch my pot because after the first 10 minutes of cooking (at the lowest setting on my stove-top), the pudding had a tendency to scorch on the bottom.  It was done after 20 minutes.  Unfortunately, it was not creamy - more stodgy, and very, very solid, even while still warm.  The cherries just couldn't save it.  Unfortunately, nobody in the family liked it and I ditched it as I know it would just not get eaten.",2004-07-10

But like other reviewers, I scaled that quite a ways back and still found it to be a pleasantly sweet balsamic dressing.  One thing I didn't like was how runny it was, and while taste wise I loved it and would definitely make again, I'd scale the hot water back and dissolve the sugar in as little hot water as possible.  This has kept very well for the whole week and goes perfectly with hearty salad greens like romaine & spinach.   Thanks!",2011-05-12

Also a dash of salt &amp; pepper. I mixed this up the night before and chilled it overnight, then had it on bagels for breakfast. It was great!

This recipe would be good for a church type function, but for us, to get up and wait AN HOUR before even putting it in the oven, then another 45 min - hour for it to cook and get on the table... too long for little kiddos.

We'll just stick with the traditional way of cooking the foods.

It is very similar to one of Mirj Mom's cakes that used ginger and apple in it. I loved the taste of ginger in particular that stands out at the end - thats, ""To die for"". I did make a few substitutions, though. I used light brown sugar instead of dark brown, as I had only light brown on hand. Also, I didn't have nutmeg on hand, and I substituted it with cinnamon. Pecans out here cost a fortune, and, I substituted those with almonds. Everything worked well. This cake took 1 hour 40 minutes to bake in my AMC Dutch oven. To make this cake slightly guilt-free, I used low-fat milk in which I added lemon juice(prepared this as a substitute for buttermilk). Everything else was perfect.
I would recommend this recipe to everyone.

It's very moist, yet not at all heavy.  Thanks a million for the recipe Steve!",2003-05-30
22133,89435,5,1,This recipe deserves more than 5 stars! My mom and I made this because we had an overabundance of pears. It definately tastes like it's come fresh from the nearest gourmet bakery. The topping is to die for.  Everyone really has enjoyed this one. Thanks Steve! ,2003-08-04
22133,73836,5,1,This is a wonderfully moist and delicious coffee cake.  I made it today to share with two friends at work and they loved it.  I will definitly be making it again!  Thanks!,2003-12-18
190680,310178,5,1,"I love these! Just made them again last night- ds requested them. :-) I never let the sausage cool before adding the cheese, so it's a bit messy stuffing the pitas, but oh, well. Really good and so easy for those nights when I really don't feel like cooking!",2007-12-31
22133,37779,5,1,"I had a church ladies brunch thingy to go to and I made this lovely coffee-cake. I used those red-skinned pears (can't think of the name of them). This was truly one of the best coffee-cakes I have ever made or tasted. The cake was moist and tender. Very fragrant, too. Gets my highest recommedation. Many thanks, 1Steve.",2004-03-27
22133,7108,5,1,"Delicious!  I brought this for a family gathering and everyone loved it.  I was requested to bring a dessert; something that needed not to be refrigerated...what a great choice I made!  It was perfect for an after dinner dessert with coffee.  The leftovers were served for breakfast to the out of town guests, so it worked out perfect.  Thanks for posting!",2004-08-17

22133,141631,5,1,I love this coffee cake .. it is soo light and full of great flavor. I have made this one a couple of times and prefer not to put the salt in until I have removed the 1 cup of mixture and then reduce it to 1/2 tsp in the main cake mix. With this last one I only put in the D Brown sugar and flour together before removing the 1C mixture. In the one C mixture I added 2 Tsp more DBrown Sugar and increased the ginger to 1 tsp (I like ginger). I then only added 1/2 C Sugar to the main cake mix. When I placed the pecan mixture on top I lightly patted it down into the cake mix. I think this last one is my favorite but at the end of the day this is just a fantastic coffee cake the deserves more than 5 stars ,2005-01-17
22133,134011,5,1,A lovely cake. Moist and very enjoyable.  Thankyou for sharing,2005-06-12
22133,28557,5,1,"Oh yum! I had a piece of this cake at MarieAlice's and it was delicious, still warm from the oven. There was just a hint of ginger and she used walnuts instead of the pecans. I know I'll be making this at home soon!",2006-03-31
22133,183872,5,1,"Oh, yum!  This coffee cake is a delight to both make and eat.  Besides making some substitutions to accomodate vegans, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was a snap to put together (I love that the topping and batter start as the same mixture!!) and baked beautifully in the 40 minutes stated.  What a treat my coworkers and I had! Thanks 1Steve, this one's a keeper!",2006-09-03
22133,186070,5,1,"I made this over the weekend with home grown pears from my inlaws tree. It was amazing.  Very moist and the spices give it a wonderful flavor.  Made exactly as written except I had no buttermilk so I subbed 1/2c. sour cream and a 1/2 cup of milk, I also added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter because I just love vanilla.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe, everyone who ate it gave it thumbs up!!!",2006-09-08

22133,280166,5,1,"Very moist and yummy!  I love the idea of not having to cut cold butter into the mix to make a streusel!  The oil is soooo much easier.  Before adding the oil I sifted the first five ingredients because my brown sugar was lumpy. For me, 2 cups chopped pears = 2 med pears. Next time I make this (probably tomorrow since I bought 5 pears!) I will add the baking soda and powder at step 3 - then add pears.  Also increase ginger in topping to 1 tsp.  I can't wait to share this cake with friends!",2007-01-09
22133,405894,5,1,This was the perfect dish along side a cup of tea!,2007-06-03
22133,191956,5,1,Just wanted to add that when I served this cake I put some fresh whipped cream on top - sprinkle some fresh grated nutmeg on the cream and WOW!,2007-06-27
22133,301487,5,1,Absolutely amazing! I love this. My husband is diabetic and so I used white splenda for the sugar and a half cup of splenda brown for the brown sugar. I cooked it for about 2/3 the time and it was great. I love the flavor. Thank you for posting this.,2007-08-13
22133,374520,5,1,This made such a wonderful breakfast on a cold day!  I used red pears and walnuts.  Everyone loved how it tasted and the only thing I might change is to drop the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  Thank you for posting such a great recipe.,2008-01-26
22133,148715,5,1,This was spectacular.  I used asian pears and only half the salt.  I will make this again.,2008-01-29
22133,300920,5,1,"Wow. So to be honest this was completely beyond expectations. We had those big asian pears around and I happened to come across this recipe. Boy am I glad I did. I would recommend this coffee cake to anyone that's looking for easy baking w/ fruit, and who wants something other than the obligatory apple crisp. The scent is extraordinary, and we'll be making this continuously this winter. THANK YOU!",2008-02-13
22133,520150,5,1,This was very good!  Shared with friends instead of my weekly muffins.  They all loved it.  My only change was to add 1/2 tsp cinnamon & ginger.  Thank you very much!!,2008-02-13
22133,297859,5,1,This was so good - it was devoured very quickly!  I liked the fact that oil was used in the cake and for the crumb topping.  I would agree with another poster to add the salt after the 1 cup of topping mixture has been set aside.  Thank you for sharing this one!,2008-04-07
22133,354184,4,1,"I thought it needed a little more ginger, or perhaps fresh ginger on top.  I had to substitute pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg, which worked out well and also substituted milk and lemon juice for buttermilk.  Everyone who tasted it said it was wonderful.  I also cooked it about 2 minutes less.  It was super moiste.",2008-06-01
22133,228672,5,1,"Wonderful, easy coffee cake.  I used 1 c white flour, 1 c whole wheat flour & 1/2 c whole wheat pastry flour and the cake was still light.  I also used almost all applesauce in place of the oil.  The resulting ""crumb"" topping was very dense and lumpy, but the lumps sunk right in the batter & added a delicious cruch to this very moist coffee cake.  Per others suggestions, I didn't add the salt until after I removed the 1 c for topping.  I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg.  Delicious!",2008-07-27
22133,570804,4,1,I was intrigued with this recipe because of the use of oil which is always easy to use. Unfortunately I can't stand pears so had to substitute apple (peaches should work very well). My DH and friends love the pear version.   The only negative for us is the sweetness so had to cut back on sugar and also on the oil by 1/4 c.   Added some yoghurt to make up for it.   It is a great recipe and the above changes are personal.   We find most coffee cake recipes just too sweet and always have to adjust.,2008-08-22
22133,173579,5,1,I loved this coffee cake.  It had just the right flavors.  The nutty topping was just wonderful.  Will make again soon.  Thanks for posting.,2008-09-25
22133,320625,4,1,"I have tons of pears off our tree...the thing is I don't like pears! So with 5 bushels a year, I desperately send things to my DH's work. This went over well but my ""topping"" sank into the cake. I don't know what the heck I did wrong. I read the recipe three times and can't figure it out. Just not the usual crumbly topping I associate with coffeecakes.",2008-10-15
22133,715178,5,1,Last night we had guests over for dinner and I served this for dessert.  It was truely wonderful. I have to take the leftovers to work or else I would eat the whole pan.  My guests enjoyed it too! Thanks!,2008-10-20
22133,725332,5,1,"This is great! Though I must admit that I didn't follow the recipe as written (I broke the first rule of cooking/baking: Always read the whole recipe before starting). I used 6oz yogurt and milk to substitute for buttermilk and I mixed all of the ingredients together except the two listed in ""Topping"". So I didn't have any topping and I added more milk to get a smoother batter. My only issue is that the pears sink to the bottom. Maybe tossing them in some flour to coat before adding to the batter will help (but maybe not, idk). Despite the errors, the cake is delish and I can't stop eating it!",2009-01-15
22133,1013852,5,1,Delicious cake! I have made this twice. It was a hit with my guests. Thank you!,2009-04-05

22133,992845,4,1,"Very good! Next time I think I will use butter instead of the oil, and add 1/2 the salt after seperating the topping (it turned out too salty for us). But this is a really good, solid, easy recipe! Thanks!",2009-10-29
22133,637486,2,0,"I'm sorry, but I just didn't care for this coffee cake.  The only changes I made was that I didn't have any nuts, so that was the only thing I left out.  I think that there was too much nutmeg for my personal tastes.",2009-11-16
22133,1376400,5,1,Outstanding! I tweaked it only a little (using 1C packed dark brown sugar + 1/2C sugar and 3/4 tsp salt) and it is still plenty sweet for me. I may try using even less sugar next time. I am also a ginger lover so I used 3/4 tsp ground ginger in the topping. Using butter is a good idea that I may try next time.,2009-11-23
22133,914806,5,1,"Wonderfully moist coffeecake! I cut back the white sugar to 1/2 cup, and will try even less next time.",2009-12-26
22133,1544987,5,1,I got compliments from the entire house on this one. Truly delicious coffee cake and a great way to use extra pears.,2010-02-07
22133,1688515,5,1,"This was really good! I bake quite a bit, but I've never made a coffee cake (thinking that they're kind of dry and not very good).  I was pleasantly surprised!  This was SO good!  Made it twice now since I have a ton of pears to get rid of.  Both times I put it in 2 round 9 inch pans and it worked out very well!",2010-09-28
22133,394077,5,1,"Man oh Man, this is an excellent cake.  The cake tastes so  good and so moist.  I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg because noone in my family likes nutmeg. I also used only 1 1/4 cup of sugar in total....Sooooooooo Yummmy!!! I served it warm with some cool whipped...What can I say except.....I just love it. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.",2011-11-04
22133,126440,5,1,Definitely could taste the ginger and nutmeg.  Loved them with the pears.,2012-04-19
22133,229619,5,1,"I had some really ripe pears I needed to use and I found this recipe. I'm glad I did!  I like the nutmeg and ginger with the pears.  I did cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup, and next time I may use butter instead of oil, but this recipe is definitely a keeper.  I'm looking forward to having this with a cup of coffee for breakfast tomorrow.",2012-09-29
22133,2324285,5,1,"This recipe deserves all of the five-star reviews that it's gotten.  It's really tasty, and the combination of pears, ginger, brown sugar and pecans can't be beat.  Thanks for sharing this.",2012-12-28

22133,1800349588,3,0,I thought this dessert was very lack lustre. It did smell delicious cooking and was very easy. I could see people really enjoying it with ice cream while warm. I can&#039;t eat ice cream so I put a heaping spoonful of some cranberries and apples I had cooked down. That added the zip I needed.,2013-11-28
22133,2352805,2,0,"Taking the suggestions of other reviewers I decreased the sugar and the salt, then made this according to the recipe. It was fair in flavor, the cake is moist. Now I think I should have made it using the quantities indicated because the changes resulted in a rather bland finished product. I&#039;m sure replacing the oil with butter, as a couple of reviewers did, would have made it more flavorful, as well as change the texture somewhat. The topping was good both warm and later at room temperature.",2014-03-11
22133,1803434027,4,1,I followed the recipe exactly. The cake batter absorbed the topping so there was no crunch. My kids and I did not care for the taste of this cake (nutmeg &amp; ginger was too much for us) but my husband almost devoured the entire pan by himself. If you love ginger and nutmeg then you&#039;ll probably really enjoy this cake.,2014-12-06
22133,2000522779,5,1,"Very good recipe.  I have made pear cake for many, many years using pears from our tree and results sometimes came out questionable.  I tried this recipe, thought it might be something different with ginger and nutmeg and no cinnamon - and it is very good, hubby loved it.  I didn&#039;t have pecans, and didn&#039;t even have any walnuts, so used chopped almonds and is great.  I also used 2% milk with 1 t. vinegar in it instead of buttermilk.  I will make again, and will try apples also.",2015-10-04

194295,11176,5,1,"What an AMAZINGLY adorable idea! In order to make this, I had to leave our rosemary plant looking like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree. *LOL*  Also, I just cut the cheese (did I really just type that?) into tiny chunks rather than stars because all my original attempts ended in crumbled remnants of cheese... which my dad happily ""disposed"" of for me.  For the top, I ate the guts out of a lemon (why yes, I DO eat lemons) and cut the peel into something almost star-shaped.  This cute tree got lots of attention; still is even now that all the ""food"" has been eaten from it! Thank you, Faith, for a darling ""recipe""! xxoo",2007-12-30
194295,444954,5,1,This is such a neat idea and makes a holiday dinner or party so much more special.  It's not hard to do and makes a nice presentation in addition to a nice aroma from the rosemary.  I will probably do this every year.,2008-01-04
194295,973916,5,1,"So adorable! I was a little apprehensive at first when my rosemary sprigs were sticking straight out at you; however, once I filled the tree in with all its goodies, I was able to pin the excited rosemary down with the toothpicks and it came out so nice. I started by wrapping my cone in Saran wrap, and then pushed the rosemary into the styrofoam carefully. I then toothpick-ed queen and kalamata olives, baby mozzarella balls, and 1/2""-thick salami cut out with 1"" heart cookie cutters all over the tree. Like *Kathy*, I too placed the Perky Olive Penguins around the base of the tree. I cannot believe I didn't take a picture of my masterpiece, but hopefully I can upload a picture from someone who did. Everyone raved about how cute this was. I will definitely be making this for future Christmases!",2009-12-26

84748,211960,5,1,"Thanks Barb - this is delicious!  - I made a couple of changes two deliberately and the others by mistake... my printer is not connected at the moment as I decorating so I wrote down the ingredients on some paper and mis-read them.  I'd already put in about 2 1/2 cups strong wholemeal flour before I noticed it was brown sugar, not flour so I did the last 1/2 cup as strong white flour.  I fancied honey rather than sugar so used 2 TBLSP honey instead, and only used 1 TBLSP butter to keep the fat low(er).  I used a whole cup of some unsweetened 'Alpen' to use more of it up, and as I didn't think there was enough fruit I added a TBLSP currants.  I added a few more TSPs water as it looked a bit dry with this particular muesli/granola, and as I almost always do a good 1/3 TSP of vitamin C powder.  Notwithstanding my multiple mistakes and the change to honey (which I liked) it tastes great with a little low-fat spread and honey.  Definitely going to make again.  Quite liked the inadvertant wholemeal flour use although I'll probably drop it just 1 cup of wholemeal next time.  I don't think it was too little butter - was still nicely buttery with just one TBLSP and certainly healthier!  Very nice bread indeed - thank you!",2005-10-03

It was easy to make and it cooked up nicely, with the filling setting perfectly - it wasn't runny at all! I cooked it probably about ten minutes longer because I wasn't sure if the filling had set or not, and then I was afraid that I'd overcooked the pie, but it ended up being just right. I used 2 cups of pecan pieces as others suggested, but I think I'll scale down to one and a half cups next time because there was almost too much filling for the crust to handle and we like the gooey part better anyway. I also used both light and dark corn syrups as suggested, but I'll probably just use light next time because we didn't really care for the flavor of the dark.

The problem I had was that they were not completely done -still runny.  I had made them the day before, so they had been in the frige overnight.  My sister, who had made Pecan Pie before told me that you have to always cook Pecan Pies longer than what the recipe calls for.  I imagine another 10 minutes would have helped.  The taste, however, even runny, was unbelievably great, so we still enjoyed them.  I will definitely make this my Pecan Pie recipe for always.",2006-12-15

I went 20 minutes over but think I could have gone 15 and been fine, I just didn't want a runny center.

101954,442490,5,1,"This pie definately had the flavor you want in a Pecan Pie. It was delicious. My only advice is this: Make sure you boil the syrup and sugar for a good 3 minutes. Start the timer when it STARTS boiling. I made 2 pies. Same amount of everything, I even baked then at the same time, however 1 pie was a little runny while the other was nice and firm. The runny pie was just as delicious as the other pie though! I just didnt boil the 2nd pie's sugar and syrup as long. SO good and will be a holiday staple in our house for years to come.

101954,318235,4,1,"I had a few questions regarding the directions for making this pie and I don't know that my interpretation worked out successfully. I heated the sugar and syrup and allowed to boil for the 3 minutes. Then I added the butter to this in order to melt it in the hot sugar. I then added the egg and vanilla to the sugar and butter mixture. I thnk that I didn't allow the sugar/butter to cool long enough because the eggs began to cook a little which made the straining difficult and I think was the main reason my pie was so soupy...not enough egg made it through the strainer. After cooking for an hour and ten my pecans in the middle were starting to burn but I was still a syrupy mess on the outter rim and inside the pie. So, I served pecan syrup with ice cream at my dinner party! The taste of the filling was better than any pecan pie I have made before so I will defintiely be giving this recipe another shot. I will probably not bother with the straining in the future.",2009-06-11
101954,863903,5,1,"Made this testing recipes for Thanksgiving. First pecan pie I've made, and it was great. Might do 2 cups of pecans next time to experiment. 
If you're worried about cooking the eggs, just temper it. Add a small amount of the syrup to the eggs and beat constantly, then add a little more. When the eggs are heated, add to the syrup and make sure you stir it for a while, or your eggs will cook. Took my oven the full hour.",2009-11-10

Buy whole pecans and chop them up (or not, I don't) - whole pecans are often better grade than the ones that got crushed in processing or don't look good and are sold as ""chopped pecans"". Some changes I made, strictly for my own preferences: I cut the sugar by about 1/3 (like it a bit less sweet than many folks), doubled the vanilla (love vanilla), and added 2 Tbsp. of bourbon (can also use rum).

I also cut back on the sugar (discovered mid way through the recipe that I only had 3/4 c. and I didn''t want to dash to the store!)  Also had to bake it about 15 min longer.,2012-11-30

101954,118163,5,1,"Absolutely the best pecan pie recipe I&#039;ve ever used. Not too sweet and sets up perfectly. I&#039;ve made it many times now, and not once had a single issue. Make sure to strain the filling mixture. It&#039;s very difficult to stop the eggs from cooking when you first start tempering them. You&#039;ll be much more pleased with the end result if you don&#039;t skip that step. Thanks so much, PCrocker!",2013-03-19
101954,59879,5,1,The title speaks for itself!  Truly wonderful pie that the men in family raved about.  Said it was the best pecan pie they had ever had. Sliced nicely and had a wonderful texture.  Not too sweet.   I&#039;m replacing this recipe with our family pecan pie recipe!,2013-04-22
101954,1900559,5,1,Great recipe and if you want make it less deadly here is how I do it.  I use the sugar sub instead of sugar and sugar free maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  My picky hubby could not tell the difference between the sugar version and the sugar free.: ),2013-05-02
101954,2084063,5,1,"Pecan pie is my husband&#039;s very favorite pie.  When Thanksgiving rolled around this year, I couldn&#039;t find my recipe box so turned to the computer recipes hoping for something that was equal to the pecan pies I have baked for 43 years for him.  I not only found a recipe like it, but found a new twist in the boiling of sugars ahead of time.  I put in more pecans and mix them in with the filling, as I always have.  The results...even thicker and more gooey than ever!!  My husband flipped &amp; even had 2 pieces!  Two days later and I&#039;m making another!  Needless to say, this is it from now on!  Thanks P. Crocker!",2013-05-31
101954,2910728,5,1,This pecan pie tested great.  I baked the pie until the center measured 200F on an instant read thermometer and it turned out wonderfully.  I highly recommend cooking the sugar/syrup mixture prior to baking. I would recommend light brown sugar and clear corn syrup so the filling does not get too dark.,2013-07-22

Leftovers of every single pie on the bar, except for the pecan pie, and it was also the very first gone before some were even tried. Had a feeling it might go that way though, because I ended up making FOUR &#039;test runs&#039; before the wedding, including a chocolate one with 1/2 cup cocoa, and they were all history by day&#039;s end.  *Instead of vanilla (except in the case of the chocolate pecan pie I made), I used a teaspoon of maple flavoring and a tablespoon of bourbon and I baked all the pies for about 55mins.",2013-10-30

Basically, you&#039;re making a soft candy, which makes it stand up better.  Then I had to play with it.  Since my pie pans are deep-dish, and I make two at once, I increased the eggs to 10, the corn syrup to four cups, the vanilla to 4 tsp and added another generous half-cup of chopped pecans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who like a bit bolder flavor, replace a half-cup of the dark corn syrup (for TWO pies) with unsulphured molasses.

My husband  loved it and he only loves his mom&#039;s pecan pie :) So that is an accomplishment. I used vanilla bean paste from Sur la Table instead of vanilla extract and that was good. I also melted the butter in the hot sugar/syrup mixture. I strained it after adding to the eggs and glad I did. There were some chunks of sugar that had not melted. My only fault was I filled the pie too full and it overflowed into my oven. So be careful not too fill to the top. It made a mess on the edges of the pie plate too and didn&#039;t look too pretty, but it tasted delicious so I guess it is ok :)",2013-11-27

101954,1800364351,5,1,This recipe was a hit with my Southern family at Thanksgiving. I covered the crust with foil and baked for an hour to get the right consistency.,2013-11-30
101954,1800369797,5,1,"The most amazing pecan pie EVER! I made this about a month before Thanksgiving, and on Thanksgiving we had a store bought pecan pie that dulled in comparison. Normally I take a big slice, and this time I could only have two bites of the store bought pie!! After making this recipe, I will never be able to look at any other pecan pie, homemade or store bought, the same! It is so so simple to make, and absolutely delicious. I made this for my boyfriend and his roommates and it was gone in a day, and I&#039;ve been getting requests to make it ever since! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I followed the steps exactly, but I added the butter to the sugar/corn syrup mix after removing it off the heat so it could melt easier. Then I followed the rest of the steps exactly. At first I only baked it for 30 minutes because it looked ready and the pie crust was starting to brown and I didn&#039;t want it to burn. I took it out and realized about an hour later that it definitely needed more time in the oven. I was hesitant about putting it back in the oven after it had sat out for so long, but put it back anyway. After an additional 20-25 minutes in the oven, it turned out perfectly! I definitely recommend leaving it the oven for the recommended time, and next time I will reduce the temperature of my boyfriend&#039;s oven because I think it is not completely accurate. Not sure if using a glass pie pan had an affect on the quick browning of the pie crust or not, or if the rack being set one higher than the center position of the oven had to do with it. Regardless, this recipe is amazing and DEFINITELY recommended!",2013-12-02

Ive never had Pecan Pie but when I saw this recipe and the reviews I had to try it out. First off I think I over cooked it, the unbaked pillsbury pie crust almost seemed to thin for the filling. It made it through the crust (however the crust really thinned out during baking. Could just be the brand of crust. Any other suggestions?? It said to cook until &quot;Set&quot; wasn't sure what was considered &quot;set&quot; since this was my first time. I have a gas stove so I am sure it cooks a lot faster or maybe I need to cook at 300 degrees? other then the top being a little rough the pie was delicious ..my kids and I really enjoyed it.

As long as you have plenty of cilantro and lime juice, it's good.  Also, if you don't have ""chili sauce with garlic,"" use regular chili sauce, and garlic if you have it. The yellow pepper adds nice color to the watermelon, but you could use any color pepper.  I would NOT substitute the sesame oil, as that gives the chicken a rich flavor.

I made the recipe as written using chicken taquitos (they didn't have the cheese in them), and ""zesty salsa"" flavored refried beans.  Next time I make these, I think I will try using green enchilada sauce as the red sauce seemed to overpower the light flavor of the chicken.

194516,166294,4,1,We enjoyed this and it was easy!  The only I have to add is that you really need to increase the baking time if you're using mostly frozen taquitos.  Mine did not warm all the way through in 25 minutes even being partially thawed.  This is definitely going to be made again!  They taste much more gourmet than they actually are.  Love recipes like that.,2011-09-15

The batter looked more like cookie dough than batter...I was worried until they came out of the oven! I filled my muffin cups almost to the top and these didn't rise at all.  I checked my baking soda and it's fine, so I guess these just don't rise that much.  I will make these again for my husband.  Thanks for posting! ",2006-02-24

I thought it might look nice to chop them finely, and sprinkle them on top with a little cinnamon and sugar.  They are SO good.  When I opened the oven to check them, it smelled like those toasted pecans and almonds you get at the fair.  mmmmmmmm.  As others have mentioned, they are somewhat crumbly, with a different texture than most muffins, so I think they work best with muffin papers, as opposed to just greasing the muffin tin.  The paper holds them together nicely.  Thanks for posting.  Made for PRMR.",2008-09-14

It also ask for 3/4 cup of oil, I used 1.4 cup of oil and a 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. That cut back on the fat and was a grand addition to the muffin flavor. I used twice of amount of pecans just because I love them. I got a pic of the 10 remaining muffins after we sampled while I still could,lol. These will not be around long!",2008-10-05

The 1/2 cup frosting doesn't even come close to covering even half of these bars.  I also thought the crust was way too thick, which leads me to believe that part of the crust mix should be left out to put on top of the filling, instead of frosting them.

I did find another similar recipe, with less eggs and no ""frosting"".  Leaves much more room for adding lemon juice.

The dough was very finicky - maybe because I used the brown sugar instead of molasses...I burned nearly half of these because the heat was too high. By the end I realized the heat needs to be low and the pancakes need to cook on each side for quite some time. They did not bubble at all like normal pancakes so you just need to keep checking if the side turned down is brown and, for me, the inside did not get cooked but was pumpkin pie consistency.

They are like a cross between fudge and brownies. I followed the ingredients (using the poster's recommendation for the lesser amount of semi-sweet chocolate chips). A few things I did differently were that I halved the recipe and baked them in a 9x13 pan. I chilled them in the fridge overnight, which did make them a bit difficult to cut. I used instant espresso powder in place of instant coffee, and I liked it, but I felt that the amount was a bit much (you could still taste ""coffee"") if serving to kids. I would probably decrease this by a Tablespoon (using only 1 Tablespoon in a 1/2 recipe) next time. I also saved about 1/2 c. chopped oreos (I chopped up 25) to sprinkle on the top, but while baking they smelled like they burned a bit. I tasted a top crumb, and they tasted fine. It looks nice, but I think I'll still just mix 'em all in next time. I baked them for 30 minutes, and they look great.

If you over bake them the top gets hard and crunchy. Just use your judgment, they are probably done when you think they are done.

55813,37183,5,1,"MEPSTER - we had this for supper last night. I did an adaptation for the crockpot, because I'm just not home long enough before suppertime to cook it as listed. The night before, I browned the meat, and sauteed the onions & garlic. I put the meat back in, and added just the beer. Got it up real hot to cook off the alcohol as much as possible. Then I stirred in the oregano, cumin & worcestershire before I put it into a shallow covered dish to refrigerate overnight. When I got up the next morning, I peeled two VERY large potatoes and cubed them into the crockpot; dumped the meat mixture in, and added the tomatoes & green chilies. Having done a few crockpot adaptations, I decided that the 1 cup of beef broth would result in a very soupy sort of stew, so instead I used one packet of instant low sodium beef bouillon (makes 1 cup of bouillon) without dissolving it in water first. I just stirred the powder in along with the tomatoes. I cooked it on low for about 10 hours. I had no idea what it would taste like, but I love green chiles in many dishes, and everything else is standard fare for our house - just never put it together like this before. Well, when we came home, (me, my kids, and a couple of their friends) one of them said they could tell we were having Chili for dinner. I said, ""Well, not quite, but there ARE chilies in it."" My kids both loved it, their guests loved it and had seconds (my kids don't eat much when the have friends over - or they probably would have had seconds as well) and I had...um...3 helpings.

I didn't puree it in the food processor; I just stirred it all together with a fork and let it be kind of chunky.  I doubled the green onions and the Mexi Seasoning.  Next time I might use even more of the seasoning!  It has a great flavor.  My husband and I just love bean dip, and will definitely make this healthier, more flavorful alternative to the name-brand stuff on a regular basis.",2009-03-29
345720,743849,4,1,"I love the texture of this bean dip - it is very, very creamy.  I used my blender to process this smooth, and am glad that I did.  I used organic pinto beans, omitted the cilantro (we don't like it very well) and doubled the spice mixture.  I think next time I would add more of the spice mixture.  I used Pace Organics Medium Salsa.  Made for Photo Tag.",2009-04-18
345720,1356721,5,1,DH's new favorite!!  He is loving this dip however I did add much more of the seasoning blend after we tasted the final product the first time.  I have also substitued red onion for the green onion when I was out and it worked just as well.  Thanks again for a keeper!!,2011-03-01
345720,58104,5,1,I used Recipe #480397 for the salsa added twice the amount of seasoning mix and opted for the pinto beans. A nice healthy snack! Gracias made for ZWT#8,2012-08-03
345720,266635,5,1,Very tasty bean dip made to go with our grilled skirt steak.  The only changes I made were the pinto beans and I added quite a bit more of the seasoning.  Served this dip alongside some guacamole and tortilla chips.,2013-05-12
345720,37449,4,1,This made a nice dip that was mild and tasty. I enjoyed all the spices and the cilantro was a nice touch. I used pinto beans from the slow cooker. Thanks!,2014-01-23
345720,2324285,4,1,"This was good dip that was easy to throw together.  I used fresh crushed garlic instead of the powder, and eyeballed the rest of the ingredients.  I probably used way more than a 1/4 teaspoon of seasoning, and it did not come out tasting overly seasoned.  I also added chopped jalapenos, green onion and cilantro.  With the pintos, this tastes like a lighter version of refried beans.  The flavor improves a lot when served warm/hot, I thought.",2014-05-07
198520,107583,5,1,This is very rich and doesn't taste sugar-free!  I like the crust made with oats better than the usual graham-cracker crust.  I made this 1/3 lower in fat by using 4 packages of Neufchatel cheese and 1 cup low-fat ricotta cheese.  I topped it with fat-free Cool Whip and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  Thanks for a new holiday favorite!,2007-12-26
484475,870705,4,1,I think it definetely has too much red pepper!  Other than that we liked it.  I cut the recipe in half except I used all the sausage.  I used about 2 Tbsps. of brown sugar and with the BBQ sauce it was plenty sweet.  I think it would work just as well with ground beef or turkey.  Thanks for posting!  Made for New Kids On The Block cooking tag game.,2012-08-28
31474,51489,3,0,The flavor wasn't bad.  I did have a real problem trying to keep the cheese on top of the breadsticks.  They seemed to get harder after having them in the oven for a second time.  Was there a trick to this that was not included in the recipe?,2002-08-25

165801,130819,5,1,I have always thought omelettes make for a special breakfast and this one is definitely special. I have added this one to my family favorites cookbook.

The potatoes and the touch of sage made this recipe.  I used 4 slices of bacon for the ham portabella mushrooms, but other than that made as directed.  The veggies came out perfectly cooked a crisp tender which is the way we like them.  Thanks Peter for a wonderful breakfast.",2007-05-26

Instead of cream cheese, I used Laughing Cow Garlic and Herb cheese.  I let it cook on low for about 15 minutes and then put a lid on it and cooked it for an additional 5 - 7 minutes.

Because I cut the recipe back I cooked it a bit differently - I sautedd all the veggies for 3 minutes added the eggs, placed the tomatoes & Parmesan on top(I didn't use any cream cheese) covered with a lid and 5 minutes it was ready. Mmmmm  I think 30 minutes would be a long time  cooking even with 6 eggs.  I cut back on the potatoes and used 4 left over oven fries chopped .. The parsley & sage are a nice addition.  Because I sauteed the veggies and didn't remove them and reclean the pan I had a bit of problem taking the omelet out of the pan.

After they had cooked a bit, I poured the beaten eggs over.  I did flip the omelet and then topped it off with goat cheese and the parmesan.

I cooked the potato and onion for about 5 min to get it going. I thought 30 min would cook the egg too much. I topped it with the cream cheese as stated and doubled the parmesan. I also added a few spoonfuls of salsa to replace the tomatoes, peppers, and mushrooms. Great VERSATILE recipe! Thank you for the inspiration!

DH was concerned with the cream cheese but I added it anyway and he enjoyed it immensely.I followed directions almost to a T however 2 things, omitted mushrooms, and cooked less than 20 min on low heat.  We use propane as there is no natural gas where Ilive so it does cook a bit hotter but 30 min. seemed a bit long.  Omelette came out fluffy and high.  I did a very short flip over to make sure all egg was cooked les than 30 sec. with the heat off just before plating.  DH was quite impressed.  This is a 5 star all the way!  I will make this again for him on a nice Sunday morning or perhaps for Christmas breakfast when the kids are here.  I will probably precook the taters so I can get the omelettes finished quicker as I can only do 1 at a time.  Thank you for a lovely recipe.

I plan to make them again soon--for just my family, when I might have a chance to try one! Thanks for posting, Andi of Longmeadow Farm! UPDATE: made these again tonight for New Year's Eve with DH and DS, and left off the green onions/chives altogether, as DS dislikes them. They were very, very nice!

My potatoes were larger than the bite-size new potatoes so I altered the technique a little plus I only made 2 medium size red potatoes for the 2 of us.  DH did not want the blue cheese on his, so for mine I put some sour cream on and then crumbled some blue cheese over it.  I just eye-balled the amount.  I loved the flavor the blue cheese brought to the potato.  I left off the chives because I was too lazy to go to the garage to get them.  Used kosher salt for the outside which I love.

Except that they were all devoured with such enthusiasm that none survived for my next day's lunch! I made some exactly to the recipe (using a blue brie) and some - for those whom I knew to be a bit squeamish about blue cheese - with a little basil pesto mixed with the sour cream. Both were eaten with equal enthusiasm. In fact squeamishness went out the window as the two declared non-blue-cheese-eaters wanted to try the blue cheese version! And those who loved the blue cheese version wanted to try the pesto version! My only change to the basic recipe was to add two cloves of finely minced garlic in the ziploc bag in step 3.

I too hovered between 4 and 5 stars for this one, mostly because I found their to be barely just enough sauce to serve with this over the rice. I would double it next time I think. I had to go with 5 stars though for ease of preparation and taste, the almonds add that little something special, reminded me somewhat of a chicken casserole that I make with almonds in it. Thanks,papergoddess, I will certainly make this again :)",2004-04-22
31078,121690,5,1,"I made this with a package of 4 chicken breast halves, weighing closer to 1 lb than 2.  They all fit in an 8 X 8-inch pan.  I didn't reduce the sauce and there was plenty, but there might not have been enough if I had made the recipe as written.  I forgot to add the almonds, so I just toasted some for a few minutes separately and sprinkled them over the top afterwards--tasted the same probably and added a little elegance to the appearance.  I also served them on a bed of egg noodles.  Excellent and easy.",2004-04-29
31078,60992,4,1,"This made a fast quick meal. The flavor of the tarragon was excellent but I found myself wishing for more veggies in it. I think next time I might add some mushrooms and celery sauteed first. I served this over egg noodles and all was eaten except a tiny bit. I might also add a little garlic and perhaps brown the chicken. I know it takes away from it's simplicity, but I think I would like the flavor it adds to the recipe.",2006-11-27

This is only one of three chicken recipes that my hussband will eat (he is not a big chicken fan).  Last night, he kept saying, ""Mmmmm - this is sooo good!""  It is so easy to make, and, yet, elegant and tasty enough to serve at a dinner party.  I will also share this recipe with my fellow friend and family recipe collectors!  I cook it exactly as is, and we eat every last bite!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe - it will be a regular at my house!",2004-05-07

31078,189156,5,1,"This recipe deserves 5+ stars!  I used just 2 chicken breasts and the amount of sauce was perfect.  I eliminated the salt altogether and it still tasted fine. The slivered almonds compliment the meal nicely and add a very nice ""crunch"".  I may try adding mushrooms next time as one reviewer suggested but it really doesn't need it. My fiance wanted to lick his plate after eating this so you know I will be making it again.",2005-02-26

The only thing I did different was leave the onions and almonds off (I don't like onions and DH doesn't like almonds)...and I was afraid this might be bland, but I so happy to be wrong!

I was a bit disappointed with the flavour even after adding some mushrooms to the sauce.  That could just be my tastebuds reacting with the tarragon though and not the recipe itself!  The almonds provided a very nice crunch to the meal.  Thank you for the recipe!",2005-04-13

31078,174991,5,1,Tarragon is the big key here.  All of the flavors blend together resulting in a very tasty dish.  I did omit the salt and used reduced sodium soup.  This is added to my quick company dishes.  Thanks for sharing.,2006-05-25
31078,13483,5,1,Another good papergoddess recipe!!  I really like tarragon so this suited me fine!! I found it a bit too salty from the cube chicken stock so I will not be using that again.  I'll probably substitute wine!! ,2006-06-11

I think next time I'll leave out the 1/4 t salt.  I didn't season the rice, and that helped. But, OH the overall taste was fantastic.  Decided it definitely deserved 5 stars.  Thanks papergoddess!

31078,319943,4,1,"I only used half an onion, and it was still too oniony.  Also should have omitted the salt as the soup has plenty.  Will use less onion next time, but we did enjoy it as the soup keeps the breasts from drying out.",2006-09-16
31078,284922,5,1,"GAH!  This was a super tasty chicken dish!  The seasoning was dead on, and the onion was a wonderful addition.  I had no idea that tarragon was so wonderful!  I will certainly start adding it to other dishes, as it made the seasoning of this dish extra special.  Thank you so much for posting your recipe, with winter on its way... we will have this again soon :)",2006-10-18
31078,212145,4,1,"The flavor is awesome!  I used 2 TBSP fresh tarragon.  I cut the chicken into bite size cubes, added 1 sm pack fresh sliced mushrooms and cooked it on the stove, covered, low simmer 30 min.  I served it with pasta and the sauce which is so delicious was used up.  Thanks for this wonderful chicken recipe.",2006-11-18

Had no chicken breasts but a whole chicken which was carefully cut into portions and I added some sliced mushrooms and garlic as one reviewer had suggested.  A larger can of soup and some cream added... What a success!  Husband usually is not overkeen on chicken... He had it last night and loved it.... Had it for lunch and is asking to have the remainder again tonight. Thanks for something so easy and delicious.",2006-12-12
31078,391048,3,0,"It was okay. My husband wasn't impressed, but I'm more the fan of onions than he is, and Tarragon hasn't been a regular seasoning in my home. The flavors were nice together in my opinion, however if I make it again, I will also do a dry rub on the chicken to marinate it for a little while. My husband suggested actually pan frying the dish for more flavor instead of baking. I think that might make a difference. Thanks for the recipe!",2006-12-15
31078,217282,5,1,WOW!!! What can I say that everyone else hasn't already said! This was so SUPER EASY!! Not to mention SUPER DELICIOUS!! My family gobbled this right up!! Thank you so much for posting!!,2006-12-18
31078,252514,4,1,"Very good, and quick to prep! Tarragon is an interesting spice I have not used before, so at first the flavor seemed strong. But as I continued to eat it grew on me! I used a 9 x 9"" dish with four Costco chicken breasts and the amount of sauce was perfect (we like lots). Also added a little Chardonnay to the sauce. Next time I might try some dijon mustard too. I loved the onions for flavor and textural contrast. If serving to guests, a few onions carmelized to a light brown and set on top of each piece of meat would look pretty against the color of the sauce. Served over rice. Thanks!",2007-01-23
31078,165263,5,1,I love tarragon so I new this was going to be good.  Did not disappoint.  I loved the addition of the almonds.  I served this with rice to soak up the yummy sauce.,2007-03-01

31078,240668,3,0,"Pretty good, but mild.  I'd half the chicken, double the sauce, double the tarragon, and put it in an 8x8 pan.  I didn't have almonds on hand... I'll definitely add them next time.",2007-03-18

31078,384690,4,1,great EASY recipe.  I doubled the sauce and used one can of cream of celery because it's what I had.  I added crimini mushrooms and left out the salt.  Served over brown rice.  The real test is that my 3 year old liked it!!!,2007-05-02
31078,455539,5,1,"EASY!  I didn't have tarragon and thought since the recipe was actually NAMED for this spice, it would be a no-go, but I did a Google Search and found that fennel seed would be an appropriate substitute and apparently it was because this was awesome!  The flavor was so good, it actually surprised me! I followed the rest of the recipe exactly (using a white onion) and DEFINITELY opt-in for the almonds! YUM!",2007-08-12
31078,307454,5,1,"Super fast and easy, this dish has the added bonus of making you looked like you slaved! I added about a cup of sour cream to the soup and it tasted heavenly. The cooking time was perfect for me, the chicken was juicy and tender. This one is a real keeper... 
Thanks for a really nice recipe!",2007-08-17

31078,327863,4,1,This was excellent! I added 1/2 teaspoon more of tarragon. The only thing I would do different next time is omit the onions as they were a little over-powering for my taste and maybe make a little more sauce to go underneath the chicken. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!,2007-11-27
31078,276108,5,1,"Excellent! Husband said ""this would impress company"". Such a compliment for something so easy to make. I too added a 4 oz. can of mushrooms over the onion rings and under the soup. We used the sauce on mashed potatoes, delish!",2007-11-28
31078,858148,5,1,EXCELLENT!!! I did not use a whole onion but no less than 75% of one and it was perfect. I also tenderized my chicken before covering them with the sauce and baking them. I would suggest doing so because they turned out tender and delicious!!! Great recipe. It will become a staple in our household. Thanks again!!!,2008-06-12

31078,851191,5,1,I added some Stove Top Stuffing   to this dish before going in the oven and it was excellent!  Every once in awhile I would just spoon the sauce over the chicken and stuffing.  Flavors were wonderful and we loved it!  Thanks for this recipe Papergoddess!  Pam,2008-06-22
31078,489593,4,1,I made this quite some time ago and realized that I did not review it. This was a simple yet tasty dish. I did leave out the salt however as the soup was salty enough for our taste. Thanks for the recipe.,2008-07-21
31078,151419,5,1,I followed the advice from the other commenters and left out the salt.  I also used the reduced sodium cream of chicken soup.  And it was just fine salt-wise.  I was quite unusual (tarragon is not an herb I've used often) and very tasty.  My one disappointment was that the chicken...while not tough...wasn't especially tender but I think that was me.  I used only 1.25 pounds of chicken but the same size pan as is required for the larger amount of meat.  I think I should have gone with a 9x9 baking pan or something.  That way the juices would have been more contained.  I did not reduce any of the sauce ingredients and there was just barely enough.  Maybe next time I'll double the sauce?,2008-09-23
31078,353485,4,1,This was very good.  I made it with a pund of chicken but kept the rest of the amounts on the rest of the ingrediants the same to have extra sauce.  I not not generally a fan of 'cream of... soups' but this is a worthy exception.,2008-11-29
31078,262312,5,1,"this is outstanding!!  i only used 1 lbs chicken but left the sauce amounts the same.  i made a few changes, i used an 8x8 casserole, i diced and seasoned the chicken first, i used more tarragon (about 2 teaspoons total...i might even add a little more next time!), i added about a cup of sour cream and some minced garlic to the sauce, and i garnished the dish at the end with fresh parsley.  this was so rich, creamy and delicious !!  i thought the flavors were outstanding.  this is a keeper.  the crunch of the almonds and onions is key.  thanks for the keeper, papergoddess!!!!",2009-01-07

I made 1/2 a recipe, used 1/2 the soup, and omitted the milk, since the homemade cream of chicken was not condensed.  This was sooo good that my normally meat picky preschooler ate almost 1/2 a breast on his own.  We had mashed potatoes with it and used the soup for a gravy.",2009-01-10

I will make it again and again! Thanks for posting!",2009-04-16
31078,131021,5,1,This was a big hit. I have realized that I am not a big fan of tarragon but I have 2 jars (by accident) and want to use some up. My sauce seemed a little salty so I think next time I will leave out the salt. Thanks for a simple winner.,2009-05-10

31078,316809,5,1,"Wow, I really liked this a lot! I'm sure I've had tarragon before, but I'd never used it myself. This was a great intro to it. I quadrupled this recipe first time out and used thighs instead of breast meat. I paired this up with brown rice, of which I made plenty. After dinner, I took the meat off the bones, portioned out the casserole and brown rice, and froze them to take to work for lunch or for a quick dinner for the kids. It was perfect! I just finished the last frozen meal earlier this week. This is easily an OAMC dish. I'll be making this a lot.",2009-06-05

Also didn't have poultry seasoning, but made my own with a mix of celery salt, marjoram, savory, thyme, oregano, rosemary and parsley.

Once cooked, I added chia seeds (because I try to get the wonderful benefits of chia into everything). This tastes somewhat like a lovely, spicy (but not &quot;hot&quot;) beryani.

236284,2874122,5,1,"Looking at all the other reviews I will say this recipe takes far less than 55 minutes.  I started it a half hour ago with thawed sausage and we are finished eating now a half hour later.  I used deer beer brat sausage for the meat.  I put all the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl added the butter and mixed by hand until it was incorporated.  Then I added the vanilla/milk combo.  If you don&#039;t have buttermilk just take your milk and add a little lemon juice to it.  They vanilla imparts a really nice flavor to the biscuits and the sugar gives them a pleasant sweetness.  You only need to cook the biscuits for about 12-15 minutes.  I did like the recipe said and did not start the gravy until the biscuits were mixed and in the oven.  Cook your sausage off, take all the meat out leaving the liquid add butter then cook your flour for 2-3 minutes then slowly add the milk keeping the gravy smooth as you add more.  Touch the heat up from about 6 1/2 to 8, until the gravy boils, then add your meat back in.  Let it cook for a few minutes until it is creamy.  Your biscuits should be done by this time.  My biscuits were not heavily browned.  They had very little browning on them but the biscuit was perfectly cooked and tasted great....I had to test one.  Don&#039;t make another type of biscuit!  At the very least, try this biscuit recipe.  It is really good.",2013-06-23

I did do a couple of minor modifications, mostly due to what I had on hand.

Instead of cayenne, I used chipotle peppers.  Great smoky, spicy flavor!

For some reason I saw ""tamari"" and thought tahini (sesame seed paste) and added that.  It still seemed to work.  (Even though I did put the soy sauce in, too).

The recipe calls for 16oz of tempeh; most tempeh is sold in 8 oz.  To make up for the lost bulk, I added some shitake mushrooms to the mix, which worked well.

I also served this over quinoa (made with oil, thyme, rosemary, and oregano).  This worked EXCELLENT.",2008-03-12

Also used about 4 oz. prepared TVP from the freezer which I added to the sauce w/the fried tempeh. Also threw in a can of 4 oz. button mushrooms  when frying up the ons & garlic. I didn't have fresh or frozen ginger so added 1/2 tsp. ground ginger when frying vegs. Next time I will add some chopped celery to the vegs, because I love it in BBQ.

There isn't even an option for that on my oven (I used 355*).  I forgot about the cream on the stove & it ended up boiling over. I had to guess as to how much more to add to make up for what was then burning on the stovetop.  So I did a lot of guessing & ""close enoughs"" & forged ahead with some serious doubts.  I used a jelly roll pan for the sponge & the batter was spread so thin that in some places I could see the bottom of the pan.

This dessert is the first of it's kind that he has not only been able to eat the whole piece, but has brought him back for seconds!  We all agreed that it's so light you feel like you're eating air.

I felt like Donkey from ""Shrek"" in the kitchen, telling myself ""I'm making waffles!"" lol I do recommend that not only the batter be allowed to sit for a few minutes after mixing, but also to make sure that it is not chilled. Cold batter will pour too thick over the waffle iron and will result in it possibly spilling out the sides. I used just over 1/3 cup batter for each of mine and didn't quite get the 10 waffles, but it was possibly due to my waffle iron size. I did find the flavor was not quite what I was expecting.

so not really a ""belgian"" waffle recipe - my son loves the taste of the yeasty belgians... anyway, i made them up and asked the littles how they liked them - and they really liked them - they are much sweeter than we usually make, which was a hit.  I made some with chocolate chips and some plain.  The batter was thinner than most waffle batters i've used - and the waffles didn't cook quite as nicely because of that - they didn't rise as much, and the top wasn't as uniformly brown as the bottoms...  Small quibbles, i guess - the littles liked them - and i liked the suggested additions and toppings - we like to mix cinnamon, sugar and pecans or chopped almonds and sprinkle it on top of waffles too (yummy caramelized tops!) - this just wasn't exactly what we were looking for...",2007-03-19

My glaze got a bit runny while setting in the fridge.

475963,1056692,4,1,"I saw this on a travel channel show and wanted to try it. I love the slight spice to this, but it looked wilted more on the show, so I&#039;ll probably try another version on this site that has you heat the dressing before pouring in on the cabbage to wilt it a bit before chilling. I may keep these ingredients but try that method. My Southern style cooking mom is always making wilted salads so that might be the difference. Either way, I used Splenda and low carb ketchup, which lowered the carbs but may also have kept this slaw from breaking down like I wanted. Fantastic flavor tho. I don&#039;t care for traditional slaw, but the flavor of this was different in a good way.",2014-01-25

My batch was pretty spicy (I used two unseeded jalapenos), but that's because the peppers I bought were unusually hot for jalapenos. That was okay, though, since DH loves hot foods. Keeps very well for a fresh salsa, too. I think I like this salsa even better than the roasted tomatillo version that I usually make (which says a lot, since I really like the roasted version too).

I didn't cook the veggies in butter but softened them in water which I added to the casserole a part of the liquid ingredients. I used pot barley because it's what I had on hand.

I've been trying to use barley more often because of it's low glycemic index. This is a marvelously delicious and very healthy dish.

I did make a couple of minor changes.  I used red onion simply because I had half of one leftover from the day before and I added a little fresh chopped cilantro to the marinade.  I thought the sliced eggs were going to look so nice arranged around the plate, but when I attempted to slice them, they fell apart and looked aweful....(I never understood the importance of those little wire egg slicers till now!)

192113,98821,4,1,I had never made karage with any ginger in it. It was a nice change of pace. A tip we use at the resturaunt is to soak the chicken in water for about 10 minutes and then pat dry before marinating. This allows the marinade to soak deeper into the meat and gives more flavor.,2007-03-10

I don't like to deep fry so I just shallow-fried the chicken, and we loved it!",2007-03-14

I was originally going to use this as an appertiser (with some different dipping sauces) but it didn't happen but I believe it would be perfect in this situation and be extremely well recieved.  Overall enjoyed but I think I will use breast meat in future.  Thank you Chef floWer.  Made for Tag Swap #2.,2007-03-21
192113,86512,4,1,This is quite good. I used 2 chicken thighs with the bone in. I skinned the thighs before marinating them. I marinated them overnight to get more flavor.

I'm not big on chicken breasts, so I'm always on the lookout for recipes to make them tasty. The sauce makes this very tasty!

My wife also enjoyed the meal.  After looking at the recipe, we decided to make a vegetable stir fry to go along with it.  With the soy in the chicken, it played around at being Asian while holding a distinctly American character.  We also enjoyed the Brown Brothers 2001 Shiraz (from Victoria, Australia) with this. The wine had a lot of cherry in it that went well with the saltiness of of the soy in the chicken.  It cut that saltiness down but then again, maybe it was salty because I didn't add enough brown sugar.  The bottom line is both the meal and the wine was good.",2006-03-25

I withheld the 1/2 cup broth and cornstarch and just soaked the shrimp in the cold sauce for about 45 minutes.  I put the shrimp in another bowl and brought the sauce to a boil.  I then added the remaining broth/cornstarch and cooked that until it thickened.  I added the shrimp and just brought it to a boil and served it immediately.  It was delicious!

I used pineapple juice instead of water and used only 1/2 the sugar. Another time I think I would cut the sugar down even more, although I am sure this would be a real kid-pleaser as written.

47670,55380,5,1,"An old childhood favorite, lost and rediscovered...I'm so glad you posted this! My father and I used to make this when I was a child; but I had long since lost the proportions of water to cornmeal. This ratio was great: no problems with lumps and perfect consistency....wonderful comfort food. Spraying the loaf pan down with cooking spray greatly eases removal of the mush. I did coat my slices in flour before frying  (the way I learned to do it) so that it makes a bit of a crust on the outside. I also found that I had better results when I used the more commercial grade (finer grind) cornmeal than when I tried to use a coarse, more natural grind meal...it was almost like the larger pieces of meal didn't stick together as well. I think I may try half-and-half of the two grinds next time as I prefer the flavor of the coarser grind. I'd never thought of having it as a hot cereal instead of setting it to chill, so I tried a bit that way. It was pretty good, although I was in more of a 'mush mood,' lol. This will definitely get used a lot in our house ~ thanks!",2004-11-08

I followed your advice and used the Chef popados pizza crust recipe #43740, making this in two 24 X 36 cm non-stick rimmed cookie sheets (I don't have a pizza stone or large cast iron skillet). I seeded my tomatoes to cut down on the liquid, baked my crusts first for 5 minutes before adding the topping, and after baking the pizzas to a point where the crusts had begun to brown and set, I  carefully poured off the liquid that had accumulated, removed the pizzas from the pans directly to my oven rack and finished baking-worked like a charm.

I did marinate the tomatoes for 3 hours and because of the other review drained the liquid.  I did throw some fresh basil on top.  I drained the liquid half way through cooking so it would not become soggy and cooked it for 25 at 450.  My husband said it was like having bruchetta on top of your pizza.

If you are expecting some kind of 'taste explosion', well this isn't that isn't going to happen.  This is a warming, soothing comfort food that, IMO, has to be dripping in syrup & butter with a little sprinkle of cinnamon on top.  A healthy dash of Pumpkin Pie Spice mixed into the cornmeal while cooking can give you a flavor burst along with some brown sugar for a sweeter version.  I also like this with apple pie filling (warmed) on top.

And hopefully my story will prevent someone else from making the same mistake. :) I looked all over the 10 types of tomatoes at the grocery store but none were signed, ""Plum Tomatoes"".  I really wanted to use the Romas, as that's my preferred tomato for just about everything, but 3 lbs seemed like an awful lot of them & I was shopping with a toddler who taste tests everything she can reach in the produce section.  So I chose the bigger tomatoes that people generally use on hamburgers & removed as much of the seeds as I could.  After dinner I sat down at the computer to research tomatoes & found that the Roma would have been the perfect choice for this recipe.  I used my food processor and the slicing tomatoes (as I now know they're called) created a very watery, unflavorful sauce that had a strange texture.  Very fine dices but never pureed, like I'd expected them to.  Chipotle chiles are a favorite flavor of ours & we loved it in the meatballs & the sauce.  I'd like to try this recipe again in the future with the Roma tomatoes as I'm sure there will be a huge difference in flavor as well as the texture.

36872,72489,4,1,"I did make a few changes.  I felt it needed more shrimp so I used 2 pounds.  IMHO, I felt 1 tsp of red pepper is way too much.  I cut that back to 1/4 tsp and with the Poblano peppers it had just the right amount of seasoning.  I also roasted the Poblanos.  Thanks PanNan, I will make this again.",2004-12-01
36872,117235,5,1,"Everyone loved it, I cut back the cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon and it was perfect, I also added more shrimp than the recipe called for. This is such an easy recipe, I've made it several times.  I will only use fresh shrimp when making it in the future, I think it makes a big difference.",2006-09-16
36872,365545,5,1,I went to post this online and found it here already.  I absolutley love this soup.  I have made it for several years since it was published in Bon Appetit.  I am famous for it at church soup dinners and get speical requests for it every time a potluck comes around.  I like the change you made for the four to thicken it...that definitely sounds easier.  I sometimes add 1 1/2 pounds shrimp instead of just a pound.  Yummy!,2007-03-01
36872,316610,5,1,"I made this once before and it was fantastic!  I'm so happy to find it posted since I came onto the 'Zaar to check for something similar, and lo and behold.

36872,737987,4,1,"I was hoping to make a chowder like the one at Taqueria del Sol in Atlanta and was floored to find the recipe by its sister restaurant Sundown Cafe. I used canned corn instead of frozen, pureed 2 cups of the soup, adding it back to the pot to make it even thicker, used 1/2 cup evaporated milk and 1/2 cup cream, and reduced the cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon. I would suggest finely chopping the onion, celery and poblano chili peppers. I also slowly simmered it for a couple of hours prior to serving it topped with shredded white chedder cheese  and a dollop of sour cream. It was delicious and I am thrilled to have a version of my own!",2008-01-23
36872,229978,5,1,This soup is amazing! People always ask for the recipe whenever I make it. I switch it up just a little by adding 4 cloves of minced garlic. I also don't like cooked celery so I use 1 red bell pepper instead and add 1 large potato to make it heartier. Delicioso!!,2011-12-29
36872,2001730180,5,1,I've made this recipe many times and it is always a hit. Go easy on pepper if your audience does not like spicy. I've made different than recipe when I didn't have everything. I recommend just as written however I always add more shrimp. Serve with toasted baguette with butter. Awesome taste!,2017-09-25
97684,95743,5,1,Down and dirty cookin' that tastes just fine.  Made this with cod using just 1T butter and subbing basil for the dill.  No leftovers.  ,2004-08-30

167070,334668,4,1,"Made this just last night and it came out really good.  I didn't have any whole wheat flour, so just used all-purpose.  The dough had a good consistency and very good taste.  

This is the first time I've seen garlic powder added to dough and it was a nice compliment.  I will try again when I have some wheat flour on hand to see how it turns out.  The recipe yielded enough dough for one 11x17 thin crust pizza.  Give this a try and you wont be disappointed.",2007-03-01
167070,1020526,5,1,I never would have thought of putting honey or garlic powder in my pizza dough.  I loved the mixture of white and whole wheat flour.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is use 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of a teaspoon.  Thank you!,2008-12-06

I used 350g 00 flour ( we don&#039;t use cups in the UK) &amp; sprinkled some semolina on the tray before placing the dough. Also added honey &amp; oil to the hot water  but waited till water was warm before adding yeast- as per  instructions on the packet not cause I was messing with the recipe. Thank you for a great recipe which will be our Saturday night pizza from now on.,2014-10-19
444295,1925885,5,1,"It&#039;s got Nutella, what could possibly be bad???  This recipe didn&#039;t let me down - and I know it will be on my Christmas Favorites list!  Made these exactly as written, except I had to leave out the nuts since I can&#039;t eat them.  Also, we can&#039;t get sugar cones here, so I used plain &quot;Pirouettes&quot; type cookies that I broke into bite-sized pieces.  Half the recipe made 15 candies, using a 1.5 inch ice-cream scoop, but that&#039;s because I left out the nuts. The scoop was fabulous, as the candy fell right out in a perfect dome into the wrappers, which were prepped in a mini-muffin tin.  It&#039;s too warm here in Costa Rica, so they needed the fridge to set, and also for storage.  For next time, I think the addition of chopped dried cherries or cranberries would be an excellent substitute for the nuts in this recipe.  Thanks so much for posting a great candy recipe!

370780,797706,5,1,"Yummy Yams! I wanted to use up only 1 sweet potato, so I used amounts for 1 1/2 servings. I tossed potatoes directly in the pot in which I melted the sugar (less clean-up). I also lined my baking dish with foil (also for clean-up). Popped this in my convection toaster-oven and it was ready in less than 30 minutes.  These truly are candied!

226218,80353,5,1,"Very delicious, although I was forced to improvise.  First of all, no chourico to be had at my little, local Greek supermarket, I subbed a spicy Greek sausage.  I also didn't have the fresh tomatoes called for, and used a tablespoon full of tomato paste, which was probably a bit too much, but still delicious.  Most of the family really enjoyed this and I'm giving this 5 stars based on my own opinion.  My kids are still at that 'iffy' stage where they want all (or most) of their food separate, and this was a little too mixed up for them to truly appreciate...maybe in a few years.  DH and I loved it!",2007-05-28

226218,58104,5,1,"Very very good! I used 2 links chorizo in place of the 1 portuguese sausage, a whole red pepper that gave it a wonderful sweetness, 1 cup white rice to 2 cups of chicken stock plenty of liquid, But did have to cook for 20 minutes in the oven. Because the rice was not done and the tighs needed more time. I also used 3 cloves of yummy garlic. Thanks for all the goodness! I almost gave this 4 stars because of cooking time is off but the flavor, little fat, and ease of the recipe brings this to 5 stars easily.",2007-05-29

Portuguese chourico is not available here, so I use chorizo.  This was also the first time I've ever eaten chorizo sausage and I liked the flavor it imparted to the dish.  I served the paella with Chiles Rellenos Puffs #221368 and to top off a fantastic meal, for dessert Crema Catalana #229274.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!",2007-06-01

The cooking times were perfect!  I had some leftovers, and didn't like it as much as when I first made it, because the rice became softer with the leftovers.  First time cooked, however, the rice was perfect, as was the chicken!  I made this for ZWT 3.  Photo is uploaded.",2007-06-03

This is the first time I have used this but it is much leaner than the chorizo, a little bit spicier and smokier.  I think I'll use this instead of the chorizo from now on.  Great flavor blend. It was really enjoyed.  Thank you.",2007-06-07

I don't have a oven-proof pan large enough for this recipe, so I had to move it from a pan to a casserole dish for the oven baking portion.  I don't know if that effects anything.  I would like to try this again with the proper pan.  Thanks!!",2007-06-26
226218,182010,5,1,"Delicioso!  I made only one change--used chicken breast instead of thigh.  I was lucky to find chourico (which is so good--I'm glad I got some extra for the freezer), and followed the instructions which are nice and clear.  You made your way into my heart!",2007-06-26
226218,223979,5,1,great Paella!  I liked the rosemary on the chicken.  The peas added a little sweetness.  This is the first time I had cooked with chourico.  Everyone thought it was pretty tasty.  I will make this again!,2007-06-26

I had to substitute chorizo, but will certainly keep an eye out for chourico for a future meal.  Lots of great things go into this, so it's no suprise it's so tasty.  And when you can do everything in one pan, it's that much better for me.  = ) Skipped the bell peppers,even though they make it look prettier, I don't particularly care for them.  Thanks for helping to make dinner unordinary.",2007-06-28

226218,395482,4,1,"Very good. Next time I will add 1/8 - 1/4 tsp crushed peppers while sauteing the tomatoes, paprika and saffron; to bring some kick to the taste. Or perhaps a mildly hot sausage, to counter the mild flavors of the chicken and shrimp. I skipped the baking part. Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat to simmer and cook for 25 minutes.

The first 2 times I used bulk chorizo sausage, rolling it into smallish balls and browning them in olive oil (my store didn't have links). That worked well and tasted good the first time but the second time they wouldn't hold their shape.  For the 3rd time making this dish, I ordered Portuguese chourico on-line. It came in links and was already cooked, so I added it in with the browned chicken thighs (which I cut into pieces). The flavor of the chourico blended wonderfully with the other ingredients. This recipe makes a fairly hearty amount for 6 people, but there won't be enough for seconds or leftovers. Thank you for posting my new favorite recipe!",2008-01-22

I omit the sausage (just personal preference).  Thank you for posting this recipe!!",2009-01-04

Used chicken breast cut in about 1 inch chunks and slightly cooked (no pink outside) during the initial browning.

I'd never made paella before (or tasted it, to be truthful) and I'd never cooked with saffron but I splurged on some and this looked like a good recipe to try out.  My husband wasn't sold on the saffron taste -- said it was a bit bitter for him -- but that it mellowed down in the leftovers the next day.  Personally I loved the saffron taste.

I did make a couple changes.  Since we don't eat pork, I used some turkey hot italian sausage links and I cooked the paella completely on the stove top because I had bread baking in the oven.  

I don't like bell peppers but since the red would look nice and I know my husband likes them, I put them in.  They really added a nice taste and I'm glad I used them (but if you tell anyone I said that about bell peppers, I'll deny it.)

This is definitely a keeper.",2009-11-25

I've made it three times now; once as the serving for six and twice for larger parties where I had to transfer to large casserole pan because of tripling the recipe.  Here is something I don't understand but noticed the first time I made this and corrected the cooking time:  the uncooked arborio rice requires far more cooking time than 16 minutes (10 minutes plus the 5 after adding shrimp).  No one else seemed to have this noticed so what have I missed?  After adding the rice, I cooked for 3-4 minutes (vs 1 minute), then added 1 cup of chicken stock and cooked until it was absorbed before adding last 2 cups, combining with meat and transferring to the oven.  I then found I had to cook for 20 minutes vs 10 for the rest of stock to be absorbed and the rice softened.  I would also use 1/2 teaspoon of saffron for 6 serving size.",2010-03-08

Instead of putting the pan in the oven I switched the food to a oven safe dish and threw in the shrimp in the middle. It needed a little longer than the directed time for all the broth to cook through but when it was done, it was the prettiest and most colorful dish. The shrimp didn't even overcook.

Thanks for the recipe and a delicious meal.,2003-06-27
28713,92337,5,1,Great jumpin Jehosaphat!! These grilled chicken kebabs were very yummy and not that hard to make.

I also used my homemade fresh salsa (which I gave a whirl in the blender to reduce chunks) and olive oil.  My chicken breasts were frozen when I added them to the marinade in a ziplock bag.  I allowed them to thaw and marinate all day in the fridge.  The aroma from the grill was great, and the flavor was even better.  The leftovers will be sliced up for fajitas.",2004-08-02

I used chicken breast fillets, and grilled them on a charcoal grill, without cutting into 1-inch pieces and skewering.  It was perfect alongside my Mexican Rice (recipe coming soon).

First I added three chopped celery stalks and I ditched the marmalade.  In it's place I used added 1/2 a can of orange juice concentrate, straight from the can to salad.  You could use a small can but I only had the regular size.  Ditched the lemon rind or juice also.  I did use the cinamon and then added a large can of Mandrin oranges, drained.  Sugar, nuts and cranberrys stayed the same those were just the right amounts.  I increased the raisans to 1/2 cup.  Oh, and I almost couldn't get the family to let it set.

105548,2000959030,5,1,"I live in Costa Rica, and stuff like Butter Flavored Crisco and Dark Brown Sugar either are non-existent, or very hard to find, usually at a hefty price. My first batch I used butter, and a local sugar :&quot;azucar crudo&quot;, sort of like sugar in the raw, and milk instead of water, and another 1/2 tsp of Vanilla, wonderful cookie! We have something here called &quot;lactocrema&quot; which is sort of part real butter and part vegetable oil of some kind.My second batch I used the lactocrema , and as I was a tad short on Vanilla, I added 1 tso of Orange extract, the rest as above, then rolled them in powdered sugar...an even better cookie! I find the butter ones to be a bit heavier than with what would be something close to butter flavored Crisco, lactocrema. My latest batch is with the lactocrema, and 1/2 tsp Vanilla, and 1 tsp of Lemon extract. This time I made 1/2 of the batch rolled in powdered sugar, 1/4 plain, and 1/4 rolled in plain white sugar. The powdered sugar ones are delicious, have yet to sample the other 2 versions. Be careful, these cookies are somewhat addictive, I need to eat least 2 at a time. And then there are the grandkids....!",2016-08-05

I'm glad I was patient in letting the Dough sit in fridge for 30 minutes actually I got busy and the cookie dough set for 2 full hours and the texture was on point. Picture cookie dough you purchase at your local market that was the exact texture, so in the recipe it says let it sit covered for 30 minutes for a reason.

When I tasted them after a few hours, I could taste the sugar, so I stirred them and put them back in the frig. I stirred them a few more times and the next day, they were the most delicious pickles I've had in a long time! Stirring them really helps mix the flavors together. My mom and other guests loved them and no one touched the store bought pickles I had. My sister loved them so much, she even put them on her hot dog! She took the recipe home with her.

127883,593927,5,1,"This fruit salad exceeds all the fruit salads I have ever tasted. It is beautiful to behold, colourful and pretty with fresh rose petals as garnish. It tastes just as lovely as it looks. I imagine it should be eaten in a garden for brunch. I thought the name was funny but it doesn't do this salad justice! I used the optional red fleshed watermelon, removing some small black seeds, I didn't have either peaches or nectarines but can imagine they would be good in it and will try next time. I used freshly squeezed lime juice, and more of it, Iranian rose water (which I find is the very best quality, please do not use Indian rose water here as it may break the recipe), creamed honey, dried Damascus rose petals but will look all over for fresh ones to make this salad encore, plus the rest of the ingredients. All the fruit I used was already ripe and refrigerated so I just waited about ten minutes before we put our spoons in. I promise to make this again. Made for Veggie Swap 36 ~ July 2011.",2011-07-05

My kids could not get enough and neither could my husband or myself...I did add about 2 tbsp. of chocolate ice cream sauce to give it that reese peanut butter cup taste..also, we found that the batter was quite runny and felt the cookies would just turn to big blobs, so I greased a baking dish and poured the whole thing in there, let it set and cut into squares, this was much faster than scooping individual cookies anyway.

I also added about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips when I added the peanut butter (I must say I do LOVE chocolate WITH PB), and they are FABULOUS.  Perfect consistency, set up very well.  I think the key to keeping these from being runny is to make sure you bring the first 3 ingredients to a FULL boil over MEDIUM heat, stirring constantly, like it says.  It takes awhile, but it allows the milk and margarine/butter to evaporate and reduce, and ensures the sugar is fully dissolved.

I found that just spreading this out on some aluminum foil and then separating it into sections seems to work well for me, far less hassle. Since the sugar/milk mixture doesn't have to be cooked beyond boiling, I bet these would work great in the microwave. Next time I will try that. I have tried it in the microwave and it worked out very well using a Pyrex bowl. I also frequently stirred/gently beat it as it cooled, similar to making fudge, and that gave it a creamier texture as well. I am probably going to try making this with cornflakes as well some time, goes well with peanut butter.",2008-06-16
129040,286851,5,1,"Excellent. Easy to make and have a wonderful taste. I did find that I needed to add about another 1/2 cup of rolled oats because the mixture seemed thinner than it should be. That amount seemed to work out well. I did not have waxed paper--I just plopped them out by the spoonful  onto aluminum foil spread out, and that worked fine--didn't stick a bit. Made about 30 medium-size cookies. Will definitely make again.",2008-06-19

129040,250427,5,1,Yummy!  This definitely took care of my rich peanut butter fix.  Based on the other reviews I used three heaping cups of oatmeal and it was perfect.  Thank you!,2008-07-13

129040,977894,5,1,These are sooo yummy!  They are quick and easy to make as well.  Make sure you bring it just to a boil.  Too much boiling makes them crumbly.  I made 1/4 of a recipe  and got about 8 smallish cookies @ 150 calories each.  This is the perfect recipe to cut in half (or less) for a treat without too much temptation!,2008-10-09
129040,928669,5,1,"These are fantastic! I grew up with chocolate no bake cookies, or macaroons, as we call them, but these are a really great twist on the original! So quick and easy to make, only one dish to clean up and they're ready to eat in no time! I added a 1/4 cup of chocolate chips when I added the peanut butter (which I only had 3/4 cup of) and they turned out beautifully. They seem a bit runny when you're spooning them out, but they set up really fast. Pretty much the perfect cookie!",2008-11-17

129040,237201,4,1,"I like these better than chocolate no-bakes! That said, I have a few suggestions. 1/4 t. of salt helps to cut the sweetness. It's easy to overcook these, so get them off the heat as soon as the mixture comes to a full boil. I only added 2.5 cups of oatmeal. 3 cups would have made them too dry. Thanks!",2009-04-05

129040,588863,5,1,This is a great peanut butter treat.  I used butter and Jif peanut butter for a richer flavor.  I allowed the sugar/milk/butter to  fully boil for about 30 seconds as I was afraid the cookies might not harden.  I also found that 2.5 cups of oats was plenty.  Too many oats tend to make the cookie dry.   Thanks for sharing.,2009-05-05

129040,1244997,5,1,"Wonderful treat! I made these using Splenda sugar mix to cut the sugar. I also used 1/2 & 1/2, a bit less than the half cup then diluted with water (had no milk in the home) and real butter. Since the recipe needs to be boiled 2 mins when using granulated sugar to dissolve, I didn't need to boil this mixture, just brought it up in temp then took it off the heat. A heaping cup of peanut butter, then added oats by sight..I tend to put less oats in and just let the mix sit for just a minute on the counter. I also keep stirring this mix when spooning out so that not 1 cookie gets that dry look, actually quite shiny and pretty!

129040,1247585,4,1,"I am guilty of having cravings for peanut butter when I get home from work or after I finish working out. I saw once on""Dr. Oz"" he suggested a healthy snack for people on the go with oatmeal, peanut butter, dark chocolate chips, and craisins all rolled up together into little balls. I tried it but they were very crumbly so I searched for a similar recipe that would stick together. I tried this recipe, cutting the sugar in half, and adding chocolate chips and craisins. They were SOO YUMMY but the texture was very sticky and chewy, basically like a caramalized peanut butter. Will increase the ratio of peanut butter to sugar mixture next time which should hopfully cut the fat even more and give it the texture I'm looking for. I can see how this would also work pretty well cut into bars as some people have suggested!",2012-01-31

I was frustrated that I had to throw away such expensive ingredients, but decided to try again.  The second time, they turned out just a tad bit better, but not much.  Still very crumbly and dry, and way too sweet.  I could hardly taste the peanut butter in them.  I think next time I will just buy them in the store.

For those adding chocolate, WHY? You miss the whole point of the recipe - these are Peanut Butter No-Bakes, NOT chocolate no bakes! If you want chocolate no-bakes why not just use a recipe for them, there are thousands around the internet? If your cookies turn out dry and crumbly, you have cooked the mixture too long. I usually don't boil for a full minute, just bring to the full rolling boil and remove from heat. If batter looks too wet after adding oatmeal, just let stand a minute before spooning out. It will firm up, then dish out quickly. I like using a cookie scoop (small cookies) or ice cream scoop (large cookies); it's faster and you get more even sized cookies.",2017-06-23

I made all the dressing but used only 1/2 C of canola oil. It does  makes a lot. It was perfect in every way! Our guests gobbled it up and came back for seconds. I'll bet this would be good with goat cheese as well.  YUM! Thanks a bunch Slatts!",2009-05-27

I was planning on taking some time to experiment with ingredients to come up with my own recipe, but I hadn't yet when I saw this one. The spices are perfect. ( I did add a little sage - not sure what a difference it made)I'll use this in a lot of different ways. I made this yesterday and mixed it with a little gravy, topped it with potatoes and baked it for about 40 minutes.

311420,2001738302,5,1,"i have been a professional chef for 30 years, and this has become one of my no-brainer go to recipes because i find it to be excellent, easy, and always gets a very good response from anyone i serve them to. i choose to leave out the Old Bay seasoning and i substitute some good powdered mustard and a good sweet paprika. i have a small deep fryer in my home kitchen so i choose to deep fry them. (i know that frying them in a stell skillet will impart a different flavor, but i like the uniformity and convenience deep frying affords me, especially if cooking for a dinner party.) i mold them in a stainless steel ring to get a nice uniform cake that is sealed around the edges. i set the fryer at 340 F, and cook them for 4 minutes turning them over at the 2 minute mark. i ofund that a higher temperature cooks them a bit too fast and the outside reaches peak color but the inside needs a bit more tome to cook them through. immediately after removing them from the fryer i season them again with a bit of good sea salt and serve them with with lemon wedges and either a home made tartar sauce, roasted garlic aioli, or a tomato and horseradish based cocktail sauce. sometimes i just put a dish of each on the table so my guests can choose.another tip for making handling the cakes easier before frying is to stretch a piece of food film wrap across a plate tightly and place the cakes on that. this makes it very easy to slide them off of the plate they are chilling on, and into my hand so i can gently place them in the fry basket or into the skillet when pan frying them. sometimes i serve them with a side of fried green tomatoes and pickled corn relish set on a garnish of mesclun salad. i have also eaten them on a butter grilled bun with a layer of coleslaw and moistened with tartar sauce, the side dish is either homemade onion rings or hand cut french fries.",2017-10-03
196808,447358,5,1,"I made this cake last weekend to use up some granny smith apples that my kids complained were to sour to eat. This was FABULOUS!! I made two small changes in the prep., but did not change your recipe at all. I split the cinnamon, using 1 tsp with the dry ingreds and the other I mixed into the apples and sugar. Since I planned to serve the cake from the dish it was baked in, I did not line with foil. But instead, coated with a cake release, and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. Needless to say, the kids had no problem devouring this cake in days, and it was enjoyed by the rest of us with a good cup of coffee!

267632,88099,5,1,"This was just wonderful Andi.  I did made it a little different as far as adding the ingredients together.  I dissolved the yeast in a cup of warm water then added a tablespoon of olive oil to the mix before adding all the rest.  I didn't have a pan big enough for the whole thing, so I made two separate loaves, which probably made it a little thinner than it would be for one.  But that is the way we like our Focaccia.  I also didn't use as much olive oil as stated, but that probably had to do with the size also.  Anyway, this was just wonderful.  Loved the crisp texture on the outside.  Thanks so much for sharing my friend.",2008-02-08
267632,246844,5,1,"This came out wonderful for me.  I had to read through the directions about a million times to double check myself, but it came out beautifully.  The dough is very wet and sticky...I was very reassured when I read that in your instructions so thanks for putting that in.  I'd never made focaccia so I didn't know what to expect.  I think I could have done a better job with the dimpling part.  Only a few of mine survived the baking and they looked so pretty that next time I will make sure I press pretty hard.  The crust was nice and crunchy due to the olive oil and the inside was chewy and had wonderful texture. I'm a beginner bread maker so if it turned out for me, you can believe it's a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Andi!",2008-02-12
267632,240552,5,1,"Yummy!!  I took a little liberty with this one and used it to make homemade pizza.

We were planning to eat it with dinner but we nearly had the whole thing just after I took the photo, without any spreads.  The taste was outstanding and the texture was like no other focaccia (Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside), it was just perfect.  I have to say it's one of the best focaccia I had eaten.  I made the rest of the recipe as written.  Thank you Andi of Longmeadow Farm - *Made for Zaar World Tour 4*",2008-07-09
267632,394077,5,1,"Ok.  here is the deal.  This recipe deserves 5 stars for taste and texture (crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside).  However,  the instruction I have to give it 4 stars because I was really confused the different spots to add the oil (step 6-8).  I improvised so the bread came out tasty but  I think the directions can be improved especially for the newbies who would like to try this recipe.  Other than that,  I love the bread.

267632,779699,5,1,"There is a story behind this: DH has usually one Saturday a month when he has a few boy-hood friend friends over to play video games the same way they did when they were 8. In keeping with that tradition I always make them snacks to munch on as they play late into the night/ wee hours of the morning after I have gone to bed. Usually I make simple ""kid friendly"" food as they really are a bunch of big kids! But I thought I would jazz it up a little this time and make it more ""adult"" so I served them this bread! I made it in my ABM to serve with recipe#403927. It came out beautifully. The only changes I made were to use sea salt in place of the kosher salt and I did let it rise twice (once in ABM and then about a 4 hour cold rise in the fridge).

I used my bread machine on the dough setting as suggested and then I began the instructions at no. 5. I used a pizza pan so therefore I didn't use the parchment for fear that it would curl and bake into the bread. I lubricated the pan very liberally and it was fairly easy to get it out although I know the parchment would have been a lot easier. The bread was also delicious tasting, and since it was cooked directly on the pan the bottom had a lovely crunch too. Super yummy! Next time I think I'll try baking some of the topping material too.

Used Tanqueray, and expected not to taste what is supposed to be a tasteless liquor, but definitely noticed its effect on us after eating 2 portions apiece along with a glass of wine.  The pepper definitely added some ""in-your-face"" flavor.  Served the shrimp over rather unadorned sauteed onions, garlic, mushrooms and green beans which were atop white rice.  The directions could be more specific as to the desired temperature at which to cook, the approximate length of time to fry the garlic, and to cook the prawns (I cooked until pink) and how long to heat after the cream was added.

87129,27783,3,0,Good. I found this recipe to be somewhat problematic for me - it came out very heavy and the texture was a bit too dense.  I did use the wheat bread setting and fresh ingredients measured according to the directions (no changes).  I think perhaps an egg might have helped make the texture a bit more tender - or perhaps I might replace the water with milk next time.  I am sorry this didn't work out as well as I had expected for me.  ,2004-06-16

87129,66083,5,1,"We really enjoyed this bread in our family.
We followed the instructions and noted that it was rather dry in the machine, but we didn't touch it.  The bread grew a bit too much and pasted its self to the top of the machine, as I had used ""bread machine"" yeast [Quick Raising]. I raised the lid just as it was about done, so that it wouldn't cook into it.  Next time, I will use a Olive Oil vegetable spray on the lid and see what happens.
For the comment about using the wheat bread setting - I would use the ""French Bread"" setting rather, as this is that type of bread [using water and no eggs] and to also note that it will be a rather dry bread dough at first.  The zuccini keeps it moist.  The crust will resemble that of a french bread when done.
We used a Balsamic Vinegar sop (dip) with herbs to eat the bread.  I am on my way to the kitchen to make it again today!  Good job!  Great bread!",2004-09-21

Crusty bread with airy inside, absolutely wonderful.",2015-06-17
87129,232037,4,1,"Turned out great... but...    First, there&#039;s no size given in this recipe. My bread maker has settings for 1, 1.5, and 2 pound loaves.  I guessed at 1.5# when comparing to similar recipes. Second, The dough was way too moist. I ended up adding an additional 1/4 cup of flour until I had a good dough consistency. Perhaps this is variable with the amount of water in your zucchini. 
Now, third is my own happy accident. I knew I had yeast, and I added all the ingredients and then went to get the yeast. It turned out to be pizza crust yeast with a firm warning that it&#039;s NOT intended for bread recipes. I was devastated. But I could either chuck the entire batch, use beer yeast (US05 chico ale), or just use the pizza yeast.  Thankfully- I took the gamble with the pizza yeast! The dough did rise slightly over the machine&#039;s bowl and hit the lid. And the crust did remind me a bit of pizza crust (not a bad thing).
Verdict: This is an amazingly light and delicious bread. And unlike any other bread recipe I&#039;ve tried in the past, it was actually soft the next day! This is the kind of bread I&#039;ve been dreaming about making.  The only question is- how much did the pizza yeast contribute versus using regular bread yeast?  Also, there was no real basil flavor. I picked fresh from the garden and used more than called for. I think I&#039;ll just skip it next time.
Edit for batch 2:  I had put 2 cups of shredded zucchini in the freezer vacuum sealed for off-season baking. I just defrosted it and decanted the water that leached out. What was left was barely a cup of zucchini. I added that all to the mix and proceeded.  Unfortunately it was too dry so I had to add maybe 1/8 to 1/4 cup of water to get everything to knead properly.  I was right- you&#039;re going to have to adjust the water depending on the moisture content of your zuc.",2015-07-21

342762,539977,5,1,"These smell excellent! I have not tasted them yet, as I want them to cool so I don't burn my tongue.. again... Anyway, easy to make. My batter was a little dry, but could be because I didn't use hydrogenated shortening..
My changes:
*used fresh ground flour (white wheat, kamut, rye and a little sweet rice flour)
*used Adams chunky peanut butter
*used palm shorteing (not hydrogenated)
used 3/4 cup chocolate chips because 12 ounces was WAY TOO MUCH. 
*I used a 9x13 pan, and they are still thick :) ALSO I cut these and got 24 good sized bars! 

To mix I used a good wooden spoon. This batter was THICK & DRY.. It didn't say to do so, but I pressed these into the pan a little, not firm, just enough so that if they didn't spread they would hold together. 

OK, I couldn't wait any longer. I baked these 17 minutes in a dark nonstick pan. They are light, and have a great crumb to them. They almost dust in your mouth. ALL the kids that have had some tonight LOVE IT, so does the DH. 

These were EASY, and FAST, and AWESOME!!  Thank you! WILL DEFINATELY add these to my regular menu!",2010-05-18

I probably wouldn't use it that way again unless I emulsified it.  It is *very* thin.  The dressing might be even better used on another type of salad.  Sliced tomatoes & cucumber?

You could literally cook it all day and the carrots would still be crunchy. Not to mention the fact that with that much tomato sauce it literally tastes like tomato soup with added ingredients. Also, I assumed the recipe called for fresh rosemary, but I'm thinking not considering how overpowering the rosemary flavor is using the amount called for. This recipe could be fixed, first by omitting the majority of the tomato sauce and swapping in broth or water. Second, by reducing greatly the amount of rosemary.",2018-04-10

First was the size of the loaf, when I saw 1 loaf and 4 servings I expected a standard sized loaf and 4 hungry people. I cut it back to use 3 cups of flour which makes a loaf that filled a 9x5 loaf pan.

The recipe was easy and very yummy, I had two bowls.  Having never had lentils before and since they look like a split pea I was figuring on a thick type soup when they cooked down, and it was almost chilli like.  I couldn't help myself after a taste test I thought, mmm wonder what a quart of home canned tomatoes would do? I did add them and the sweet of the tomatoes blended very nicely.  I had been wanting chilli:) The simmer of the ancho's then processing them til smooth paste is a wonderful technique that I will use for other sauces, enchilada :) I served this with cornbread and I put a dollop of sour cream, chopped green onions and chunked cheddar cheese.

It is our favorite meatball dish on the site so far and I have been member for over 10 years.  The meatballs were perfect, soft, tender and oh so full of flavor.  The gravy was terrific.  A wonderful meal served over soft egg noodles.  Thank you so much for sharing a recipe that has gone into my Favorites Cookbook for 2014.  Kudos to you.  Made for Spring Pac 2014.",2014-04-14

368156,197023,5,1,"Seriously YUMMY onions and, as Baby Kato promised, an eminently versatile dish. We've enjoyed these in sandwiches and blended into creamy mashed potatoes. So much tastier - and considerably less expensive - than the commercially available gourmet onions I've bought from time to time. My only modifications - to suit our taste preferences - were to omit the curry powder and to add some cinnamon. Loved the inclusion of the paprika and the cinnamon - an addition inspired by the Zaar Kitchen Dictionary - blended beautifully with the other ingredients. Thanks for sharing this great recipe which I'll certainly be making again!",2009-10-16

930,677508,4,1,I liked the consistency of the baked beans but I'm used to a sweeter version.  So I may add a little bit more brown sugar next time or use molasses.  I did my bacon in the microwave too and just mixed the bacon crumbles up in the beans.  I cut the recipe way back since I was just making them for 2 of us so they baked/set up quicker than the full recipe.  Went great with the turkey pepper jack hotdogs we had for lunch today.  Will make again.,2012-05-21
930,140132,5,1,I made this last night to go with the meatloaf I made for my guys.  I halved the recipe as there wasn't many eating last night and it was wonderful.  These beans are simple to prepare and I alway have the ingredients on hand.  Thank  you for sharing with us.,2013-02-07

Since I was eating this at work, I was not able to follow your suggestion to enjoy with a glass of wine; instead I paired it with a hard-boiled egg, a few slices of salami, a few creckers for spreading, a bit of good cheese, and a little fruit.

I divided my dough into 3 logs and baked one so far, 2nd one is for Nov 17 when DD comes home again and the 3rd is for us.

83435,920541,4,1,"I am really pleased with this recipe and would have gone five stars had I not taken some liberties to adapt to what I had in the pantry. I used white spelt flour and substituted reduced fat sour cream for the applesauce. I made it a few days ago, and it has held beautifully, becoming more flavorful and staying very moist. I toasted the nuts (pecans) before adding and chopped them coarsely; the texture of the nuts with the nice dense oats is great. This is not a light, cake-y banana bread but rather a substantial, rich loaf that is perfect for breakfast or a mid-afternoon snack. Really satisfying. Family loves it. Next time I will add a little more cinnamon and a little more salt, but I think the base recipe is solid and this is just tweaking on my part. It's a keeper, thanks for posting.",2010-01-06
83435,402279,5,1,Very good! I subbed 1/2 cup oat flour and omitted the nuts. Baked in silicone muffin cups for 30 minutes. Will definitely make again. Thanks!,2010-05-12
83435,573325,5,1,"This bread was very, very yummy! It was more of a cake, with a soft, spongy texture and sweet, nutty taste. Mmmm, we all enjoyed it very much for breakfast today.<br/>The vanilla went great with the intense banana flavour and the chewy oats. YUM! We made half the recipe ending up with two rather large round breads, that were devoured quickly. The dough was very nice to work with and everything came together rather quickly, too.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this great recipe with us, Kree! :)<br/>Made and reviewed on recommendation of starrynews December 2010.",2011-01-01
83435,588412,5,1,"This is a great recipe, I'm always looking for ways to bake with oats.<br/><br/>I made some minor changes, I cut the sugars to 1/3 cup each of the granulated and brown, with makes a total of 2/3 cup.  The recipe as written, 6 tablespoons of each amounts to 3/4 cup total.  I also cut the salt in half as baking soda has a lot of sodium.  Next time I'll omit the salt altogether. I made it with old fashioned oats as I don't use the quick kind.  I also added some chocolate chips.  I baked it for 1 hour and 5 minutes.<br/><br/>I liked the flavor and texture a lot. I think it tastes better the nest day.  I'll be making this again.<br/><br/>An observation.  Bananas vary in size and the amount of banana used has a big impact on the moistness and texture.  While this worked out great for me this time, next time might be different.  I wish banana bread recipes would list the amount of mashed bananas in volume rather than so many bananas.  Next time I'll measure the mashed bananas and make a note of it (and hope I have it right, lol).",2012-10-08

I sprinkled just a little sugar on top of the batter before baking, which made it slightly crisp. I did have to bake it 27 min, so 9 more than called for. I didn't need any syrup either; it was delicious on its own! I reheated for breakfast the next day in the microwave, & it reheated pretty well, just a *bit* soggy.

77479,55380,5,1,"A huge hit with the kids (and the mommy ;o)...I made two of these for four of us and they were still squabbling over who got the last piece, lol. For a dinner when all five of us are home, I think I'll have to make three! It rose higher than I'd anticipated; almost more of a cake or cornbread than what I usually think of as a pancake, but as far as we were concerned, that made for an even more special brunch/dinner. I used frozen blueberries, thawed and drained...if using frozen, I think the thawing and draining step is crucial to having them turn out well without throwing off the cooking time or making them soggy (the berries had a *lot* of juice when they defrosted). If I use frozen next time I may sprinkle them with a little sugar as they didn't have as much of their original sweetness. Even so, none of the kids even asked for syrup (which, as far as they're concerned, is a food group, lol); it was plenty sweet on its own. I only topped mine with butter.

I used Clabber Girl pancake mix to make 3 different types of ""pancakes"":  blueberry, peach and strawberry. I took the advice of another reviewer and sprinkled the fruit with sugar before adding the pancake mix.  I found that these took around 24 minutes to bake, but, then again, I was using an oven on a houseboat - probably not as good as the ones at home!

Mine was a bit underdone, but I figured that was because I used frozen blueberries (w/o thawing). It was done on top, but not underneath; next time I will just cook it on the bottom rack; that should solve the problem. Even though I didn't drain mine, I was pleasantly surprised that the wedges came out easily and intact--they were not too mushy! However, I can't see how this recipe could serve 6, because 3 small kids and a pregnant mommy cleaned this up quick. I do love how you get waaay more berries per bite than average blueberry pancakes!

I learned the hard way that extra extra virgin olive oil have poly phenols that can turn your recipe bitter when emulsified.  I used a light olive oil and it still came out awesome.

I wasn't sure it would turn out okay - especially with no flour and no leavening - but the end product came out moist with a nice light texture. DH absolutely loved this cake and ate several pieces, which was very unusual for him. One suggestion to make the prep REALLY easy: pulse the almonds and sugar in a food processor, then pulse in the cornstarch and whole pitted dates.  The dates chop up perfectly and the ground almonds/sugar/corn starch keeps the date pieces from sticking to each other. This one's a keeper!",2007-06-08

117202,212417,5,1,This was such a good coffee cake! YUMMY! DH has been requesting it ever since I made it! Thank you for posting!,2006-05-31
117202,324840,4,1,"It wasn't the best cake I've ever tasted, the baking soda tasted quite strong. I was quite surprised it turned out actually, since I've never baked a cake where I had to split the dry ingredients in half and layer them as the base. The base was actually a little crunchy. Cold butter was hard for me to cut in, so I semi-melted them so they were sort of soft. It's quite dense, and I didn't sprinkle the nuts, just the  chocolate chips on top. As shown in the pictures, I used a round tin instead, it seems it serves 14..! Not too bad nonetheless, but am still in search for that coffee cake :)",2006-10-04
67202,59473,5,1,"What a nice easy way to prepare potatoes. Instead of inserting the butter in each slice I still cut the potatoes in slices, but I just spread the butter over top and sprinkled the garlic salt on top. They turned out great. Thanks for a terrific recipe.",2004-07-11
359090,50969,4,1,"Before giving my review on this, I have to say I'm pleased to be the first one to rate this recipe. This was made on 3/29/09 for mine and SO's dinner.Since I used a home made pie crust instead of the ready-to-use, it took me a bit longer to make. For the veggies, I used some leftovers that had previously been frozen. When this is made again I think the amount of herbes de provence will be cut back to just 1/2 tablespoon, the full amount to us seemed a bit over powering. And I'm going to omit the milk, since the pot pie was a little on the runny side. But other than that, we found that this was a very good dish. This will be made again. Thanks for posting and, ""Keep Smiling :)""",2009-03-30

40556,136147,5,1,Sooo good!  Made this today for our Easter Ham & it was really a hit!  I used 1/2 tsp. of allspice instead of the cinnamon & nutmeg--I really liked the added touch of clove to the ham.  It was a wonderful taste!  ,2005-03-20
40556,73836,5,1,This was the BEST ham glaze ever!  I made this yesterday for our Easter ham and everyone was very impressed with it's flavour as was I.  I think this is the one I will use from now on.  It really was delicious and my ham came out looking fantastic!  Thanks so much!,2005-03-28

Thanks for this delicious new favorite!",2005-10-23

394369,583349,4,1,"This is a very moist bread!  I was intrigued by the use of yogurt instead of oil, and it's a technique I will use again.  The molasses was a bit too strong for my tastes, would probably decrease that and increase the brown sugar a bit next time.  Thanks for sharing!",2010-08-17
394369,573325,5,1,"YUM, this bread is sooo good. Its very fruity with a great moist texture and lovely crunch to the crust. I loved how easy this was to prepare and how yummy it tasted. I used half whole wheat flour, left out the molasses due to all of those raisins being very sweet and decided to make muffins out of the recipe. That worked out very well and I ended up with a very satisfying breakfast muffin.

When I read it I thought that it probably shouldn't be called a vinaigrette with a T of sugar in it, but it's still plenty tangy.  It just doesn't take your breath away as some, loaded with vinegar, do.  It's perfect.  And it's just become the official house dressing.",2003-09-09

I followed your directions exactly, but I found that the vinegar took over and it was so strong that I really couldn't even eat it. I don't like giving negative feedback, but in my opinion the amount of vinegar should be adjusted. I plan on making this again, but will cut the am't of vinegar in half. ",2004-02-10

I dislike it so much when people completely change the recipe and then give it 5 stars...  I only used half of the sugar because I don&#039;t normally like a sweet dressing but everything else was as written.  The next time I make this (and I will for sure), I may add all of the sugar just to see what it would be like.  As it was, it had a nice little tang - I&#039;m having it on my salad tonight.

Very tasty, thank you.",2008-05-28

I also scaled the recipe in 1/2 and put it in a small glass loaf pan to bake. It took about 30 minutes to cook through, but I suspect it took longer due to the cold potato I threw in cooling the whole thing down. Very good, sprinkled some garlic powder on it and we enjoyed it very much for brunch. Thanks for posting! made for Aussie Swap :)",2010-01-20
265314,463435,5,1,"When asked by the kids what I was making for lunch today, I told them ""Hidden Eggs"". That seemed to peek their interest, so they all came to the kitchen to see exactly what it was I was doing. They saw me pulling apart a loaf of French bread into tiny little pieces and seemed fine with it. However when I cracked the eggs over the butter drizzled bread all 4 exclaimed they were not going to eat it. We have a rule in our house you either eat what is fixed or go hungry...so they all planned on tightening their belts until dinner time. As I topped the dish with pepper jack cheese (That's all I had on hand) my son decided he might try it. Once it was baking in the oven and the smells began wafting through the house they all decided they should give the dish a chance. I made enough to fill a 9""x13"" pan, and there were no leftovers! All four kids had seconds, and they asked if I would make this again soon. I'm planning on making this again next week! Thanks for the keeper Crafty Lady. Made and reviewed for the 54th AUS/NZ Recipe Swap.",2011-07-05
265314,2000985881,5,1,"That was very good.  Its completely gone now. It was enough to feed 3 adults. I added in some chopped up onion (1/2 of an onion) to the egg and some garlic before i poured it over the dripped buttered bread. I also half cooked 3 hashbrown patties (just to brown and unfreeze them) I cut them up and shredded them over the egg mixture. I also had some round sausage patties that i cut up and spreaded over the whole. One more barely layer of that cut up bread remains, drizzled the butter and added the cheese.

I took my first bite, which was from the bottom of the slice and it really wasn&#039;t sweet at all and didn&#039;t taste very good(during the baking, the filling rose quite a bit on the one side).  Once I got some of the filling it was much better.  I would definitely make this again, but change things up by making 1/2 of the filling amount(it seemed to be out of proportion compared to the batter) and adding that other half of the sugar into the regular batter.

122968,453440,5,1,"10 Stars aren't enough! Within one week, I made them for a family get-together and a campground pot luck.  I got ""mega"" compliments for the pinwheels but you deserve the ""all"" the praise for a ""super"" easy and ""super"" tasty recipe. Printers are still making copies, including mine!  I used all your ingredients but did do things a little differently.  I mixed the chilies with the cream cheese but sprinkled the pimento and black olives & cheese on top after I spread the cream cheese mixture.  After rolled & chilled, they looked so pretty when I sliced them.  I did slice them in a 1/2 inch slice and served them with a med. hot salsa.  I have no doubt that sour cream, grated lime rind and a bit of lime juice and minced celantro would work too.  I plan to try that the next time I make them.  I think a ""key"" to success is patting the chilies, pimento and olives dry.  Thank you Marg,  This is a ""keeper"" and a ""favorite"". :)",2010-08-13
122968,1584953,5,1,"I've made these pinwheels many times, and always get rave reviews. After reading some of these reviews,let me give some tips that I hope will be helpful. Don't attempt to slice the rolls, until after they've chilled in the fridge for at least a couple of hours, and the cream cheese has ""set up"". Also if you put a tortilla shell (I do one at a time) in the microwave, for about 12 seconds,on high,before you spread on the filling, they roll up much easier. Also, the kind of fillings you can make are only limited to your imagination. The cream cheese is the only primary,and necessary component. (oh, and the tortilla shells, of course).

The sauce was sooooo yummy and I will use it for other dishes like stir fry etc. even without the chili sauce. I did add a little corn starch to the sauce. I wasn't sure what type of vinegar to use so I just used red wine vinegar and it was great. Also used splenda rather than sugar.  Even the picky 7 year old loved this and ate it in record time.

I've never tried it with peaches, but I did with apples and it is fantastic!  To get a little more sauce, I added 1/2 cup water to the apple mixtures.  It works with apples, but I don't know what it would do with any other fruit.  Thanks Love2Eat for posting, and saving me some typing. :)",2008-10-06
40178,763912,0,0,"Hi Loves2Eat

I have tried this recipe twice with apples (never peel them), but not yet with peaches.  It is quite tasty; I add a few extra spices and half the sugar (WheyLow) for our preferences.  I never really get a sauce with it,  the apples remain on the top sort of.  The cake bakes up feather-light around the apples.

I melt the butter (use Smart Balance, really) in a pan in the oven, saute the fruit with spices on the stove, mix up the cake then pour the melted butter into the batter and whisk it together. 
Pour the batter back into the oven pan, then put the sauted apples over the top and bake as directed.  The second time I used KA white whole wheat flour and it was still light as a feather.
So it is easy to modify this recipe as well as make a lite version without really compromising.  My Idea of a GREAT recipe!!

I must be doing something wrong for not getting a sauce, but we are happy with this.  I would guess this recipe makes  about 4 servings--at least it does for us.

Thanks

Tagged for June/July Bevy Tag 2008.  MAMA this is HOT,HOT,HOT.  DH loved it.  I cried through much of it.  I am not used to the heat but made as directed figuring I could handle it. Well, let me tell you I doused myself with fresh italian bread between each bite and loved all of it.  DH wants this again.  I will make again but reduce the hot peppers and put on table for DH to add to it.  The flavors were great.  I also added lemon wedges at the table as suggested and they did give a fresh value to the eal.  I cannot wait to use fresh from the garden tomatoes to make this super supper. YUMMY!

Followed everything else as stated BUT when I added the white wine I also added a few tbs of heavy cream and about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. I thickened it  a bit with cornstarch then got it to the perfect consistency adding a little pasta water. We will make this again soon because dh said he LOVED it.,2008-07-01

Too spicy for mine and my hubby's taste.  I gave it a 4 star because of the ease of the recipe  and because I think the flavour was quite good despite the heat .  I did not have any lemon, so I did not add any.  Maybe that was my mistake and it would have somehow counter acted the heat? I did add about 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese to try and reduce the heat.   I will make this again, I just will decrease the peppers...",2008-08-09

I doubled the recipe and quadrupled the garlic.  I used crushed red pepper flakes vs jalapeno's and also quadrupled the tomatoes (because we love them).  SUPER packed with delicious flavor and kick!

Changes I made -- used two medium sized tomatoes, regular white onion as I didn't have any green onion and 3 LARGE garlic cloves.  No wine - although I suspect that would be a wonderful addition.

I only used about 1/4 cup of the pasta water but, in the end, probably could have used 1/2 cup. I would DEF make this again! Hubby loved it!

144728,726534,4,1,"Even if it is low fat, 616 calories per serving is waaaaay more than I want to eat for dinner, no matter how romantic the meal is!  I lowered the calories by making the 8 ounces of pasta yield four servings instead of just two (4 ounces of pasta per person is a HUGE serving).  That cut it down to 324 calories per serving, a lot more reasonable for someone trying to lose weight.  Other than the humongous serving size, this is a great recipe for losing weight because the result is totally satisfying and extremely delicious, even with half the the pasta.  I loved it, and my non-dieting husband loved it too.  He said it was ""restaurant quality"" (he ate more than 1 serving, of course).  I started out with only 1 tablespoon lemon juice but I couldn't taste it at all, so I added another.  I still couldn't really taste it so I'm not sure why so many people thought the recipe was too lemony.  I didn't have any regular white wine so I used rice wine, which is a little more robust than regular table wine, so maybe that mellowed out the lemon.  Or maybe the people who thought it was too lemony didn't add the wine at all??  I also cut the red pepper flakes down to 1 tsp. and that was plenty hot for us.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'll definitely be making it again.",2011-10-26

Reduce pepper flakes (a few shakes will do, unless you like breathing fire)<br/>4. Add a few tsps of sugar to counteract the bitterness of lemon<br/><br/>I also used cooked shrimp I had on hand (just add it at the end) and omitted the green onion, it came out great!

I substituted green onions for the regular onions simply to use up some that were soon to go bad.  I also used red pepper instead of green pepper because that was what I had on hand.  The ingredients more than filled 1 deep dish pie shell, so I added a little more of everything and made two.  We enjoy quiche for supper and eat (and freeze) the leftovers for breakfast - so it wll not go to waste.  Thanks, Trisha!",2004-05-25

I pile my filling ingredients (except eggs and cream, of course) into my shell, dump them into a bowl, toss with flour, other dry seasonings, then put it back into the shell and mix the custard.  Then I pour the custard over all, stopping when it's full enough. Sometimes I waste a bit, but I don't mind. This works for me every time.

74483,59679,5,1,I used chicken tenderloin in this marinade but figured a marinade is a marinade. This was excellent!!! The chicken had an excellent flavor. I used a Corona for beer. Don't know if that had an impact but it was all I had in the fridge and I know it goes well with citrus flavors. Am making again tonight! Then perfect summer marinade!,2005-06-19

74483,618101,4,1,"The first time I made this chicken there was some thing missing. Tasted something dissatisfying.
There was too much butter to be put in. 
I put in 1/2 cups of lemon juice. 
One bottle of Samuel Adams original beer.
1 teaspoon garlic salt. 
2 tablespoons fresh garlic. 
1 teaspoon lemon pepper. 
With six chicken breasts. 

The second time was the best because  I made it different. Made some changes. 
I made 6 chicken,  left it marinating for 2 hours (I was just running out of time and I and my husband where very hungry, but if you can leave it overnight the better it will tastes).
2 or 3 tablespoons of butter. 
Did not put in lemon juice.
1 teaspoon garlic salt 
1 tablespoon fresh garlic  
1 teaspoon lemon pepper.
For the beer I use one bottle of Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic.
And I baked it for 50 minutes. 
It was so tender and juicy, the flavor was so so so good.
This beer chicken tastes so good, so far this is the best beer chicken I have made.
If you want to make something out of your imagination, make this beer chicken.
Thank you for the recipe.",2007-11-29

For half the marinade, it was 3/4 cup lemon juice but I used only 1/2 cup which was perfect.  I used a Stella Artois beer.  But next time I'll use a stronger beer.  I used garlic in a jar.  And since I don't have lemon pepper, I omitted it.  The taste is wonderful.  We all loved it.  Thanks Kit.  Made for Zaar Star Game.",2008-04-19
74483,248023,4,1,I ended up using chicken drumsticks ( our favorite cut  and budget friendly) and only made half the marinade...  after reading the reviews I decided to cut down on the amount of butter and lemon juice...  I think I used two large juicy lemons and only 2-3 TBS of butter...  I added both granulated garlic and minced fresh since we love garlic.  The butter thickened up immediately after adding in the beer so I massaged the legs with it before letting it marinate for 4 hours.  We ran out of gas on our grill so I had to broil these in the oven.  They had a lovely lemon-y beer taste and crispy skin.  I know they would be even better on the grill so we will be making them again soon...  thanks!!!,2008-07-25

I don't like bones (yes, I know - Wimp factor 100) so my breast fillets are marinating ready. I used a Corona Beer as a reviewer recommended, I matched the colour to the beer in the pic. I am also going to serve with the green beans &amp; chips as the picture looks so appetising. Well, and peas &amp; some salad &amp; tomato sauce (ketchup). Tomorrow I will do roast potatoes (I made double quantity chicken). I used the full amount of lemon juice, if I need to use less next time, I will cook some form of rice, like fried with peppers in. I didn't have lemon pepper, so used ordinary black - perhaps I won't miss it with all that lemon juice there but I am going to locate some to see if it makes a big difference. I will try mixing grilled (broiled?) lemon zest (to dry it) with pepper too to see what that's like. I fancy lemon pepper on fish &amp; potatoes. Tomorrow I will do roast potatoes not chips (I made double quantity chicken).Next time I cook this from scratch I am also going to make your cheesy potatoes &amp; onions for the grill as well as rice (I don't have a BBQ so I use the oven, grill or hob or combination of).",2017-07-10

The only thing I did was to warm up the beer, lemon juice and spices a bit before adding the warm melted butter. Amazing flavor and juicy and tender.

He said that the taste reminded him of bananas foster (which happens to be his favorite dessert).  The day after I made this bread, DH was still making comments on how good it was.  The bread is moist, sweet, and has a wonderful flavor.  The topping reminds me of pralines and it compliments the banana flavor of the bread perfectly.

59900,394077,5,1,Light and fluffy. Oh boy it's delicious.  I used half oil and half butter.  I skipped the topping and still love the bread.  I made muffins out of these and baked at 350 for 28 minutes.,2007-08-30

This bread was so wonderfully moist and flavorful.  I made the mistake of letting my topping set up before putting it on the bread, but I reheated it and spread it on there anyways and it was still really, really good.

I should have baked it a few minutes longer, but was on the phone when I took it out of the oven and was distracted and didn't check to make sure it was done. . . my fault!!  But that was at 50 minutes, so it definitely needs longer.  I followed the recipe exactly how Evelyn wrote it (in parentheses).  Will be making again!!  :O)  UPDATE:  I made this again today using 1 C. all-purpose flour and 1 C. whole wheat flour.  I also mixed in 1/2 C. cauliflower puree to give it a nutrition boost (Like Jessica Seinfeld's book) and you couldn't taste it at all!  Great recipe!!

59900,451042,5,1,"AWESOME, SUPER MOIST BANANA BREAD, TOPPING COMPLIMENTS THE BANANA BREAD PERFECTLY!!! This is a huge step up from average banana bread. The crunchy sweet topping is like praline candy and the bread is incredible. Here are the changes I made: I lined each loaf pan with parchment paper which keeps the bread very moist. For the bread I used 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar. 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract, for the buttermilk I used 4 T. Wal-mart brand vanilla yogurt, it tastes more like pudding, 1 teaspoon baking soda and 2 teaspoons baking powder. For the topping, when the bread was done baking, I sprinkled the toasted pecans on top of the bread first. Melted one stick of butter and 10 packed tablespoons of dark brown sugar with a splash of half 'n half. The half 'n half gives it more of a candy taste. Poured this liquid goo goodness all over the tops of the pecans, covering every inch. Broiled for 1 minute until it bubbled. Let cool and husband is still gobbling it. Thank you!!!",2009-05-11
59900,43388,5,1,"Absolutely phenomenal banana bread! I make it in a Bundt pan, so I omit the topping portion and multiply the rest of the ingredients (including the original poster's recommendation for baking soda as well as the baking powder) by 1.5 and bake it exactly 60 minutes. Comes out perfectly every time! In a pinch, I have also subsituted sour cream for the buttermilk when I did not have it available and that works just as well! :-)",2009-06-22
59900,1345326,5,1,"This is so different from the same boring banana bread.  Very moist.  Not sure if I did it wrong, but the topping soaked into the bread. Tasted delicious though.

59900,247780,5,1,"Used extra thick double cream instead of buttermilk, other than that I followed the cake recipe exactly. I didn't have enough butter left to make the sauce exactly, but left it to cook a bit longer (just a bit) with more of the cream i used (instead of milk)to make caramel/praline kind of deal....it was so good. Thanks again.

Made this again 3/1/10.  Still fabulous.  Just wanted to give all you guys a hint that I've learned over the past couple of years.  If you freeze bananas when they start going ripe they will keep in the freezer for months.  Here's the hint...when they thaw they thaw into MUSH! exactly what you need for banana bread and it only takes about 1/2 an hour for them to thaw.  Just make a slice in the side and squeeze into a bown...no mashing and no ruined bananas. Voila!",2010-01-03

Thanks so much Evelyn!",2010-03-31
59900,342580,5,1,"This was fantastic. I halved the recipe, then doubled the bananas and the liquids... I used a combo of whey and sour cream b/c I had no buttermilk. Then I had no pecans, so I used some walnuts. The topping was truly YUMMY, but the caramel DEFINITELY NEEDS SALT. It makes all the difference. There's a reason why salted caramels are popular. I kept wondering if I should scoop vanilla ice cream on top of this b/c it was SO GOOD.",2010-06-08

The bread alone is perfect and the topping is over-the-top delicious, although I will cut back the nuts to 1/2 cup next time (personal pref but Hubby did love the nuts). I added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder and really liked the texture of this bread over others I've tried. You don't need to add salt to the topping as another reviewer suggested if you use salted butter - there's plenty of salt in the butter and it comes out beautifully. Thanks so much for the keeper, evelyn!!<br/><br/>Update 4/3/11: Made this today without the topping and it was still sublime!

Hands down, the best banana bread I've ever eaten; very moist, very flavorful.  Everyone whom I've allowed to sample, stands in absolute agreement- it is the ""Best-Ever Banana Bread (honestly!)"", honestly!  <br/>The only thing I did differently was to use 5 bananas instead of 4  (only because I couldn't bare to throw away a perfectly good, nearly-rotten black banana), and I baked mine in 7 mini loaf pans in lieu of 2 standard, and I think 6 would have even been better.

Also, it is possible to put too much ""filling"" onto each chicken breast and this will make it difficult to roll.  However, in spite of my learning as I went, they turned out wonderfully.

I'll probably leave out the season salt next time as a personal choice. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe I'll definitely make again and again! :)",2007-04-23

34499,455539,5,1,"One word for ya...OMG!!!  
(I guess that's three.)
I have never had a recipe taste this great! EVER!  The only thing I changed was that I added an envelope of LIPTON GOLDEN ONION SOUP MIX to the soup/milk/wine mixture. I also listened to the other reviewers and cooked the chops in the pan for only 3 and a 1/2 minutes per side.  Then for only 48 minutes for the first bake; and then only 25 minutes for the final bake. 
HOLY CRAP this is the BEST pork chop recipe IN THE WORLD!  
I will never even look to improve this one!

I also used cream of chicken because it is what I had.  I added a can of drained mushrooms.  Instead od white wine I used beef consume.

(I did make one change...I used canned chicken broth instead of white wine.) The pork was JUICY, TENDER and VERY TASTY. I served it with mushroom flavored rice and sweet corn. This afternoon, we used the leftover pork to make sandwiches.....YUMMY! This recipe is a KEEPER! I'll be making this one AGAIN & AGAIN! Thanks so much.",2007-12-30

I did use a little more flour, breadcrumbs and an extra egg but could have been the extra chop. The sauce will was the perfect amount. I was a little worried that they would become soggy and the breading would fall off in the oven, but it remained nicely intact. Very tender.

34499,705337,5,1,"I made these tonight and took someone elses suggestion about substituting Chicken Broth for the white wine (because I had no wine on hand...darn) and also substituted Lipton Onion Soup Mix for the mushroom soup. I only made 4 loin chops and the bread crumbs and eggs worked good for 4....a little more may be required for 6 chops, so just keep that in mind.  Also I baked mine for 40  minutes at 350 degrees the first time around (but my oven does tend to bake faster than some) and about 25 minutes after the soup mixture and they were perfectly done and so, so tender! I do have a tip, If you do add the Onion Soup Mix you might not want to use the seasoning salt because the 2 of them together made them a little saltier than I would have liked.  But still all in all, what a great recipe and I will definately make them again.  Thank you for a great recipe!!!",2008-01-13

34499,260325,5,1,"Stupidly good.

I've been meaning to make these for awhile, and finally did the other day.

My favourite part of this recipe is the ease and relative cheapness. Most of the ingredients I already had on hand.

Followed the instructions as listed with no changes. I can't think of anything I would change anyway. The flavours blend together very well.

I did get a bit careless while making this and burned the chops while frying. Baked them anyway with the rest and they turned out salvageable. The sauce really helped into fooling my taste buds. :P

Used boneless sirloin chops and didn't experience any of the reported dryness.

Definitely plan on making again. Thanks for a delicious dinner.",2008-04-12

I thought they were very flavorful, but my kids didn't really care for the sauce that was on them (that is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5).  I guess the flavor was too complex for them.  I reduced the cooking time too.  After pan frying I baked without the sauce for 30 min. then add the sauce and baked for another 30 min.  They were cooked perfectly and not dry at all.

Because it's obviously a popular recipe, I felt free to add a heaping 1/2 tsp or so of red pepper flakes - that worked out really well and will do again!

I didn't have the white wine on hand so I did sub chicken broth for that. Also I was out of milk, so I used half and half. How creamy was this sauce, wow !

I baked them for 40 minutes and then included the sauce and baked another 20 minutes.  They were not dry and were very moist.  If I were to use thicker pork chops, I would extend the baking time.  I also included the worchestershire as others suggested.  Thanks Yooper for the wonderful recipe!",2009-01-29

Served it with left over mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  One of the men loved dipping his broccoli in the sauce.  He wants his broccoli with this sauce from now on.   Husband loved the sauce on his potatoes.  Also (as recommended) cooked it 48 minutes and 25 minutes after the sauce was added.  I forgot to cover the meat for the first 48 minutes.  No problem.

This really is awesome!  I cooked 6 pork chops since I thought my brother was coming for dinner  - -he didn't and my dh loved this so much he tried to eat ALL the extra chops!
I used one of those mixed pork chop packages (on sale) and they weren't very thick, so I cooked them 30 minutes covered and then another 30 with the sauce - they came out so tender and juicy -  yum!",2009-02-20

34499,324677,5,1,"5 stars from my husband.  I personally don't eat pork, but I made this for the family tonight and everyone gave a thumbs up.  As I only had 4 medium boneless chops, I only used one egg and 1 cup of breadcrumbs and everything else was eyeballed.  I skipped making the sauce, as I knew my kids wouldn't eat it (they hate anything with mushrooms).  Because the chops were smaller and boneless, I put them in the oven for only half an hour.  They came out just right!  Thanks for an easy recipe and a great way to dress up pork chops.",2009-03-22
34499,213909,5,1,"""Awsome"" is right. I have made many pork chops over the years. This is the best in the oven recipe!!

Otherwise, I made as directed, and the whole family gave this 5 stars!  (Actually, DS-5 gave it 3 stars, but from him, that's equivalent to a 6.5, trust me.)  I did have to use a lot of prep dishes, and they need to be started pretty early, too, meaning I have to remember to thaw the chops more than 2 hours before dinner...  So, for us, this is not a weekday meal, but certainly perfect for Sunday dinner.  We'll have these again for sure!",2009-04-02
34499,479756,5,1,OMG - I had read the reviews and just knew I had to try - this was out of this world! DH said this was definately a keeper.  I too added just a bit a worchestershire sauce and I also added about 1/4 c. grated parmesan - and it was great!  Thanks yooper for sharing!,2009-04-03

Then I reduced the temperature to 375 to finish baking them, then I added the sauce which I doubles since I had 6 larger chops.  Everyone loved them and I did not have to dirty up the stove with pan frying since my cleaning lady was here today.  Next time I will make egg noodles and pour the sauce over it.",2009-04-22

Made these many times and they turn out moist and delish every time.",2009-06-03

I made these for my husband & he said they were hands down the best prok chops he ever had. He seriously ate 2 of them in 4 bites each!!! I enjoyed them too. I used chicken broth instead of wine since I didn't have any. I made them with some roasted potatoes & green beans. An amazing dinner & now I have to say I will definitely be making pork chops again in the future. Thanks for a great recipe!!!,2009-10-02

He normally removes the breading mix before he eats the chop but not tonight.  Asked for more & will pack for lunch tomorrow.  I always read the reviews for hints and then note them on the recipe.  Had to make my own bread crumbs from an artisan loaf I had left over & had dried out which made chunky crumbs that added to the appearance and flavor.  I used chicken broth instead of wine.  The chops were moist, tender and well seasoned.  Will make regularly & spare the expense of the boxed mix that has tripled in price since I first started using it.",2009-10-12

There was enough sauce for 3 pork chops and pasta, but if I were serving 6 people I would need more sauce for the pasta. I will definitely make this again sometime.

I like the sauce and think I might try adding sauteed onions and garlic to it next time because I love everything with that combo!

I also added some chopped onion to pan after browning the chips and caramelized them then added to the sauce.  Next time I will double the amount of the sauce as it was killer.  The chops were fall apart tender.  A keeper!",2010-06-15
34499,49361,5,1,Utterly fantastic!  I used (4) very loin chops (about 1/1/2 inches) Very tender and flavorful.  I used Italian seasoned Panko breadcrumbs.  I browned them for 3 minutes per side and baked for 40 minutes prior to adding the sauce.  This is a keeper!,2010-06-17
34499,615706,5,1,"I used cream of celery soup (all I had on hand) and it was fabulous! Also used other suggestions such as adding: worcestchiere, hot sauce & whole carmelized onion...simply the best pork chops ever!!! Served with steamed green beans & brown rice.",2010-06-20
34499,230834,0,0,Love this when I'm craving comfort food.  Followed the recipe except for the wine part and I added mushrooms.,2010-07-26
34499,323555,5,1,"Ohmygod, so good!  I used three center cut chops, and followed the advice of several reviewers and cooked 40 minutes before the sauce, 22 minutes after.  My additions:  Tabasco to the egg mixture (I also used liquid egg whites), copious Worcestershire to the soup (ff cream of celery), garlic salt & onion powder on the chops before pan-frying and in the soup mixture, a dash of Emeril's Bayou Blast for a little kick in the soup, and I carmelized very thinly sliced onions in the pan with the chops when pan-frying.  I put the onions in the soup mixture while the chops were in the first round in the oven.   I had this over whole-wheat egg noodles with steamed veggies, and it was fantastic!  Definitely a repeat per my hubby's request! Ditto on the making extra sauce next time!",2010-08-14
34499,138429,5,1,"Having some pork cutlets to use up ,I decided to use this recipe. I baked them for  half the time without the sauce and when adding the sauce I baked them for 30 minutes. I did add a bit of dill to the soup mixture. They were wonderful and a dish I will make again soon. I will use pork chops next time. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.",2010-08-19

I usually only make 3 pork chops, always add a can of drained mushrooms, but NEVER skimp on the sauce.  We like to eat ours with some angelhair pasta and fresh green beans.  Simple and delicious!",2010-09-07

34499,1671793,0,0,These were amazing. I used pork medallions instead and substituted the mushroom soup with low fat chicken soup instead coz that's what i had in my pantry. I also just gave them half an hour in my countertop convection oven instead of all the cooking time. Turned out perfect. My boyfriend doesn't usually eat pork especially breaded and fried coz he's always on a low fat diet. But he begged me to make this again. Absolutely gorgeous thx,2010-10-14
34499,1133190,4,1,These were pretty good. My husband really liked them.  They were a bit time consuming to make.  If you like pork chops I'd say these would be worth a try!,2010-11-24
34499,744367,5,1,"This is my second time making this. Somehow i missed rating and reviewing it the first time. My family absolutely loved it. The first time i didnt make the gravy, but i didnt pass it up this time. I didnt have any white wine or apple juice or white grape juice but i didnt have just enough blackberry arbor mist and decided to add that and it was delicious!! otherwise nothing else was changed. The whole time i was cooking all i kept hearing was how good it smelled. Thanks for a delicious recipe! This one will never leave my kitchen :)",2011-02-08
34499,447199,5,1,"DH really loved this, almost as much as his favorite, Pepsi Pork Roast(recipe#:13269). To the flour mixture I added seasoning salt, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper. I used a Chardonnay and added about 1/4 extra. It was just slightly bland, so next time I'll add Worchestershire sauce as another reviewer suggested. Overall though, definitely a keeper! Served with No Cheese-Whiz Broccoli Rice Casserole (recipe#:105080) which was also really delicious.",2011-03-24
34499,1853619,5,1,I have not eaten pork chops in over 10 years. However after trying this recipe I will never eat them not other way. This has to be the BEST recipe since the dawn of time. They were SOoooo fall off the bone tender and the flavor was AWESOME!!! OMG. I am a very happy cook right now I cook seven and only share with two others...they loved them. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHARING.,2011-04-06
34499,364211,5,1,"This was very good and so easy to make.  I only made up 2 porkchops for this.  I washed the chops then a good shake of garlic salt and black pepper, dredged in flour and fried til brown on both sides.  I cooked the chops, covered with foil, for 40 minutes in my toaster oven, then added the sauce ingredients.  I made the whole recipe for the sauce.  While this was cooking I put a pot of water on to boil and made Recipe#30358 to make egg noodles.  Looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow.  Can't wait to try this on chicken.   Thanks, yooper for posting this recipe.",2011-04-07
34499,54678,5,1,We all enjoyed our dinner last night. Had no wine so subbed apple juice. Served with couscous and garlic broccoli 132765,2011-04-14
34499,247007,5,1,These WERE awesome as it says!  SOOO excited because my hubby is not a pork fan however this recipe won him over!  WOOHOO!  I only made 4 chops though not 6 and cut back on the bread crumbs because of this to 1 cup however i STILL had a lot leftover so i really think since you are not adding anything to the bread crumbs to use less and you can always use more if you need it - i hate throwing so much unused away! used garlic pepper for the garlic powder ... Also I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom as we never have liked the mushroom flavor... and it worked great!  increased baking temp to 375 and baked for 40 mns first then 20 mns after adding soup mixture as i was short on time and this still worked out great!  also will double sauce next time as i served it over angel hair pasta and needed more sauce.  WILL be my GO TO pork chop recipe thanks so much for sharing as now my hubby will eat pork since these were definitely tender!!!,2011-05-04
34499,1715470,5,1,"These tasted so amazing!  My hubby was so tired after work, when dinner was ready, I served him in bed on a TV tray.  By the time I got back to the kitchen to grab my tray, he had already screamed from the bedroom twice how unbelievable these were!   I am not fond of pork chops but these were delicious.  I had already marinated my pork chops in Italian dressing and added fresh garlic to it........I feel this really tenderizes the pork.  So from there I followed the recipe.  Pan fried as the recipe calls for, only used panko's and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  If you make this recipe....You will love it!  Thanks Yooper!",2011-05-10
34499,928301,5,1,"My husband said it was good, then told me because of this meal it seemed like I wanted something.  I guess that means it's really good.  I did what others said because I didn't feel like waiting.  With baking I gave 40 minutes then added the sauce then gave 20 more minutes.  I had pretty thick pork steaks and they were well baked so I don't think anyone has anything to fear about cutting 30 minutes from the wait time.",2011-06-24
34499,444938,5,1,"Very simple, but it take a while to cook.  Great flavor.  I used Panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs because that was all I had and I would relly recommend them!  I made them with stuffing.... good compliment.  NOT a low cal meal, but comfort food at it's BEST!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  :)",2011-08-04
34499,1352292,4,1,"The picture looks just like it does when it comes out of the oven.  I thought that the chops were very, very tender, and if I could give 5 stars just for that, I would.  However, I thought that the breading came out soggy in the end, and the browning time was too long.  Even on medium/high heat, 5 minutes turned my chops too dark.  If I were to make this again, I would brown it less, and add the sauce during the last 15 minutes, perhaps.",2011-08-15
34499,636029,5,1,"This recipe was absolutely scrumptious!  My finicky bf after his second bite stopped and said, ""do you wanna get married, because cooking meals like this will get you married.""  I thought it funny but that's how good these pork chops are!  Oh and I made them exactly as the directions describe.  Thanks for posting this!",2011-08-17
34499,894563,4,1,"I tried this last night. I did two different things. I didn't have wine, so I replaced it with water, and I put it in the oven for 45 minutes, took it out put the sauce in then put it back in for 20 more minutes. It was super soggy. Heck, it was soggy when I took it out before I put the sauce on it. Because I use thinner chops then some people I might just fry them instead, heating the sauce separately and pouring over it before serving. Also, I made 8 thin boneless chops and 2 cups of breadcrumbs was a HUGE waste. Next time I'll use 1 and add more if needed. Flour was too little and so was the egg, but my fault for adding more chops :)",2011-09-14
34499,919451,5,1,"This was a BIG hit with my family!  I didn't have breadcrumbs, so I crushed saltines and added Parmesan, oregano and basil. I also substituted the mushroom soup with Recipe #18157 because DH doesn't like mushrooms (even if I try to sneak it in!)   It was so yummy.  My DH was VERY sad that there was barely any left for his lunch the next day!  Thanks yooper for such a great recipe.",2011-10-27

34499,368572,5,1,"Loved the recipe! The only thing I did different was that I happened to have a few fresh sprigs of rosemary and thyme, so I soaked them in the wine while the pork was cooking. This addition elevated it to a very good entree from a canned mushroom-soup dish. The pork was moist and tender.",2011-11-02
34499,76824,5,1,I have made them about 5 times now and I get rave reviews each time I have made them! They are moist and so tender you do not need a knife to cut them. I used golden mushroom soup instead of the cream of mushroom.. and I double or triple up on the gravy depending on the side dish. <br/> Thank you so much Yooper,2011-11-07
34499,2102550,0,0,AWESOME is right!  I decreased the oven cooking time by 30 minutes as the porkchops I used weren't very think.  This dish is moist and flavorful.  Try it!,2011-12-13

Thanks yooper!",2012-01-10

There was plenty crumb mixture to coat my 8 chops generously; in fact, next time I'd reduce the crumb mixture by half. Used recipe #360192 with minced sautéed mushrooms rather than canned soup.

I only did two, and they were done within 35 min (I used a temp probe), so I just made the sauce on the stovetop and served it over the chops.

34499,117221,5,1,These were so moist and delicious.  It was really easy to put together too.  I did use cracker crumbs with some Emeril Italian Seasonings because I didn't have bread crumbs and used water instead of white wine...we don't have white wine.  I added a can of mushrooms also.  I would like to try this on chicken some time.  Thanks for a great recipe.,2012-04-19

I doubled the recipe, and baked it in my large clay SchlemmerTopf.  Cooked it 1 1/2 hrs first step, 45 min second step because it was about 3 chops deep instead of a single layer.  Used chicken soup instead of mushroom because that is what I had on hand, and apple juice in place of white wine.  Also only had plain bread crumbs, so added about 1/4 - 1/2 cup Italian seasoning (I tend to dump, so am not sure of exact amount).

I listened to the reviews and substituted the wine with chicken broth and loved it even more! It&#039;s just my own personal taste preference to substitute the wine. I&#039;ve also added saut&eacute;ed mushrooms to the gravy, which my husband loved also. I do agree that there might not be enough gravy and suggest adding more broth or milk to the soup base or possibly another can of cream of mushroom.",2013-09-17

I too baked the chops for only about 45 minutes before added the sauce and then only about 25 minutes with the sauce and they came out &quot;melt in your mouth&quot; delicious.

I doubled the sauce and used 2 cans of soup, 3/4 C milk, 2/3 C of white wine.  Perfect amount and it tasted delicious.  The white wine adds a nice flavor to the sauce.

They did fill the bill on gravy for me though, I like to &quot;sop&quot; LOL I added another can of soup to insure i&#039;d have enough for my biscuits. all in all, a good recipe i&#039;ll go back to and tweak to make it mine.

The total cook time listed is way off.  If you cook for the full time listed in the recipe, it should be closer to one hour 30 minutes (add another 10 minutes for prep) so I don&#039;t know where the 2 1/2 hrs comes from which is listed at the top of the recipe.

Thanks so much for posting Yooper:),2015-01-05

34499,2000605488,5,1,"I made this recipe (below) for dinner tonight, &amp; we all thought it very tasty! It seems like a lot of steps, but it was easy. I will definitely put this meal in the rotation; especially during the chilly months ahead. 

My recipe was a tad different...
Instead of using eggs, I first dredged the chops in seasoned flour, then milk, then breadcrumbs (which I had to season since they were plain). I added Cayenne to the list of spices (all of which I winged rather than measured). I substituted 3 of the 4 tsps olive oil with Crisco.

For the sauce...I used cooking sherry since we were out of white wine. I do believe wine would be best, tho. The sauce is quite rich. I&#039;ll add some Worcestershire next time, too.
I added just under a tsp of minced garlic to the sauce.
Instead of mixing the sauce ingredients in a bowl, I added the sherry to the still-hot pan to loosen the tasty bits, then (after removing the pan from the burner) I stirred in the soup, milk, &amp; minced garlic.

Cooking time: 
I made sure to brown the chops well. The breading needs to hold up crispy after the sauce is added.
Since the chops were thick, I baked them for 50 minutes before adding the sauce, then another 20 minutes to finish.

Bake-Along-Side dish:
I seasoned some baby carrots with pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, &amp; 1/2 tsp brown sugar, drizzled a bit of olive oil over them, wrapped them in foil, &amp; placed them beside the chops in the oven. They came out tender, but not mushy.
I also cooked up some long grain rice during the final 20 minutes.",2015-11-12

The dough did not look good.  It was in small chunks- not at all what I expected.  I added a little water and used the mixer to incorporate it so that I could roll it out.  I thought it tasted okay.  We'll stick with our chebe bread mix for crusts.",2009-09-26
379635,1605809,5,1,"Okay, so I read Lexington6933's review and anticipated having to add more water to this as my machine was making it. Indeed, I ended up adding a cup of warm water as my mixer was kneading. Of course, that turned out to be a bit too much so I added about 1/2 cup of Bettie Hagman's four flour blend (note to self - next time add the water gradually!). Anyways, for all that, the dough was still a little sticky but it held together quite well. I used oiled fingers to flatten the dough on PAM sprayed parchment paper then filled it with what I had at the time [bacon and mozzarella cheese]. I can not believe how good this crust is!  It is chewy, crunchy and flavorful ... all things I thought I would have to give up [like my beloved Guinness...]. If you are going to try this, I recommend watching the knead cycle and pour in warm water in small quantities until the dough holds together but isn't sticky.  You will be richly rewarded with one of the tastiest gluten-free experiences.  Thank you for posting this recipe!",2010-04-27

I'm not usually a fan of feta, but had it on hand along with the other ingredients.....and just loved the final product!  It sounded similar to a cool tomato salad that I make in the summer with mozzarella and basil....but I never would have thought to bake the tomatoes in the olive oil....just wonderful, as it really brought out the flavors of the tomato, garlic and basil!

19188,62477,4,1,"I invited my daughter, 2 DILs and 6 granddaughters over for lunch and a day at the pool, and I served this with a salad.  It was perfect and a hit with the adults, although the DGDs couldn't be persuaded to try them.  The oldest is 8, and had never seen crepes before!

The only changes I made was to use soy milk in the crepes, for my lactose-intolerent DIL, and also to drizzle a tablespoon of the sauce inside each crepe.  It really made a lovely presentation, and 2 per adult was a perfect luncheon portion.

The next time I make them, I will be sure to make the crepes the night before to cut the prep time.

Guests did find the dish salty, but mostly loved it anyway.  As written, this recipe will give sharp bursts of very hot heat.  The next time I make it, for personal preference, I will mince all the peppers up instead of using them as a garnish.  Here is a tip - if you want more control over the heat, you can remove some of the inside ribs, core and seeds from the peppers, chop them up, and simply add more until it is hot enough, as that is where most of the heat resides.  Another tip - if you have access to an Asian market, they will sell Asian basils for much less than the supermarket prices.  Thanks, GinnyP, for a top notch (and easy:-)  ) veggie side dish!

My sister even commented that the kitchen smelled of the oil.  

When I browned the chicken, I was expecting much more of a coating on the pieces.  The chicken did fry up, but perhaps I would try using Panko next time for a crunchier crust.

Ultimately, the strong sesame oil flavor did not overpower the chicken.  The sauce cooked up nice and thick and coated the cooked chicken well.  I didn't use the chili paste or hot sauce, because I am a whimp. Next time though, I will try using the panko.",2007-07-02

128732,2236640,0,0,"Okay, clearly written from a Euro perspective.  If you are cooking in the US here are a few helpful 'adjustments'.  2 and 1/8 cups self-rising flour = 2 cups all purpose flour   2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder,   1/4 tsp. salt (and perhaps 1 additional tablespoon of flour).  The 1 tsp. vanilla 'essence' is vanilla extract.  (helpful in binding the dough). Or if you're using the  8 grams of vanilla sugar,that = 2 teaspoons.  2 and 1/4 kilos of apples is about six cups -- but basically whatever it takes to fill your 9"" springform pan. The egg depends on what you are using -- if you use small or medium eggs you'll need to use the whole egg for the dough.  If you are using a large or extra large or jumbo egg you may be able to squeeze out enough to brush the tops of the lattice -- but really, is there much harm in cracking another egg to brush the top?  Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about when they refer to 'custard powder' -- I know traditional thickeners for pie are flour, corn starch (which is what I'm guessing is meant by 'custard powder') or tapioca (which comes as a flour or small pearl -- if using the small pearl it is important to let the fruit sit in its juices for awhile before adding to the pastry and baking).  Thought the one reviewer's suggestion of just a little ice water (which is also used in traditional American pie crust) was a good one -- but just a little :)",2012-04-11

139,1177291,5,1,"This turned out really well.  In a hurry to make the salad, I forgot to toast the coconut, but the salad was still yummy!  Someone was entralled enough with it to want the recipe!

Thanks a lot!",2009-03-12
139,937870,5,1,"This curried mayonnaise is fantastic (it deserves 10 stars).  I didnt have coconut milk at home so used coconut cream instead and have made four batches already (and I have only had the recipe for a week).
Neither I, nor my family are coconut fans, so I made my own chicken salad and just used the curried mayonnaise dressing with it and it is a new family favourite recipe, thank you so much for the amazing mayonnaise!",2009-08-31
139,675434,5,1,"Absolutely amazing!! This is my favorite lunch. I get excited when I can make it and take it to work. Thank you, thank you..",2010-06-02
139,169122,5,1,"I just made this, and am another delighted fan! I substituted plain Greek yogurt and a pinch of stevia for 1/2 cup of the mayo, and I used chives instead of the spring onions. DEE-lightful! Certainly a keeper, thank you.",2015-10-15
202288,352597,5,1,This was Wonderful. I made this twice and everybody loved it. In the second one I used a ready made tart shell and it was also great. My boyfriend is begging me to make it again...thank you for sharing!,2007-01-04
72519,60260,5,1,"Delish!  My son is a pancake lover and he thought these were great.  I used 2 frozen bananas (thawed), all white flour and put about 1/2tsp vanilla instead of the nutmeg.  (I didn't use the nutmeg becuase ds probably wouldn't have cared for it - for me I would have used it!) Another way to use up the too ripe bananas - yeah. The recipe made 14 (1/3 cup) panckes.",2003-12-09
72519,42720,5,1,"Ouisey, these pancakes are so delicious!  I was attracted to this recipe because it called for whole-wheat flour and that is all that I used.  I did not add any regular flour.  I also used egg substitute in place of the eggs and I used Splenda in place of the sugar.  I am trying to make our meals a little more heart-healthy, as of late.  The substitutions worked very well.  These pancakes are light and absolutely filled with flavor.  We will be using this recipe often.  Thanks so much for sharing!!",2004-02-15

Yum, Yum, Yum.

72519,242578,5,1,"These were great! Half portion wheat flour made me feel good as it is healthier than using all purpose flour only. So, eating a bit healthier and still eat things I like is awesome! Made it for my family and coworkers.  Got great reviews! Will be adding some walnuts and chocolate chips (semi-sweet) to make it for some family friends. ",2005-10-22
72519,227652,5,1,"Really good! I also used all whole wheat flour & used 1/2 cup Splenda. I might try used whole wheat pastry flour in place of the white flour next time-just to see how it works. I just used 1 tsp cinn, applesauce for the oil & 2 cups buttermilk. I got a LOT of pancakes out of this-I used about 1/4 cup of batter & got about 24! Great to use up some ripe bananas. ",2006-04-03

506883,305531,5,1,Yummy good. Reminded us of a Taco Bell Mexican Pizza. I baked mine in an 8x8 square (tortillas barely fit) but it was very easy and very good. Will be made again. Thanks nochlo for a nice keeper. Made for PRMR Tag.,2013-12-10
506883,1250369,5,1,"Hubby and I love this. I leave out the beans (hubby does not like them). I add sour cream, onions, lettuce and tomatoes on top after it is baked.",2014-01-03
236816,261510,5,1,"This was so, so good!!  It was my first time using shirataki noodles and I'm glad I chose this recipe.  I used a little olive oil to cook the veggies and I added garlic.  At the very last second I decided to add about 1/4 cup of shredded mexican style cheese and about a tbsp. of taco seasoning recipe#45798 to the pancake mixture and it was a great addition.  I used cooking spray to fry the pancakes with.  Thanks for a great recipe, Pilocrates.  Since these taste great room temperature, you could make these smaller for a nice appetizer topped with sour cream and salsa.",2008-01-22
345371,829181,5,1,"Delicious!  The grilled eggplant with the cream cheese mixture was divine.  I had an eggplant that was about to turn, and I ended up eating the whole thing by myself!  

Instead of tortillas, I used flat bread and heated them up over my stove to crisp the bottom.  

Wonderful recipe, thanks for posting.",2008-12-30
78289,41809,5,1,"WOW!!  Fantastic steak, KC!  Very simple to fix, and uses ingredients I keep on hand, anyway ...  The sauce is TDF!  Be good on most any meat, but, it sure dolled up the sirloin!

78289,40620,5,1,"This was a good dish that could be used for a fancy dinner and it really wasn't that hard to make. The sauce had a nice flavor and a beautiful color. I cut my onion into large wedges so that any who didn't like it could pick them out. I used dijon mustard over horseradish. If you like your steak well done cook it a little longer at the beginning of the recipe, I had a couple of pieces that were deep red on the inside so we had to nuke them. The steak was tender and the mushrooms added an excellent texture to the dish. I made escalloped potatoes with it. This dish had so much gravy that next time I will make mashed potatoes so that the gravy won't be missed out on. Thanks.",2004-05-17
78289,108488,5,1,"Beautiful!  I will make this again, with a touch of garlic.  It was a real crowd pleaser, the sauce is just right...not too heavy.  Simple to prepare with pantry ingredients.  Thanks for sharing this!",2004-07-03
78289,169460,5,1,"Very good.  I had a very inexpensive (read ""cheap"") cut of meat and didn't know what to do with it.  This sauce made it taste wonderful.  I will use it time and time again.  Thank you",2004-11-08
78289,243672,5,1,"This is the best tasting steak and gravy I've had, even DH absolutely loved it and he ""hates"" mushrooms. This will definitely be making more appearances on my dinner table. I cooked the steak completely then set it aside whilst I made the sauce then poured the sauce straight over it on the plate. I only used 1 tbs of flour as I didn't think it needed 2 and I used 2 cups of stock instead of 1 to make a thinner sauce. Was great with potato mash, green beans and hot bread rolls. Thanks for posting this great tasting, easy to make recipe.",2005-09-17
78289,181131,5,1,"Oh. Wow. Yum. SOOO good. I also had a lot of sauce at the end, so I cubed the leftover steak, put it in a small pot with the sauce, and diluted (you could use half & half or milk) for an extremely flavorful cream of mushroom soup.",2005-09-18
78289,161282,4,1,"This dish was quite good, but for some reason my sauce didn't seem to thicken the way I would've liked. I think next time I'll use heavy cream instead and maybe add a clove of garlic.",2005-09-29
78289,322754,5,1,"Your title and comments say it all... it is easy and delicious!  I used 16 oz portabella mushrooms and 8 oz white mushrooms.  I had to use an extra Tbsp of flour to make the sauce thick (probably because the portabellas had a lot of juice) but it was excellent.  I was happy with how tender the steak was and we had no leftovers.  (Between my fiance and I, we were stuffed!)  I served this over rice and next time I will try mashed potatoes.  There was a lot of gravy so I might put in an extra 1/2 lb of steak as well and some more horseradish as my fiance can't get enough of it.  Thanks!",2006-12-12
78289,254805,5,1,"Oh yummy, yummy! The sauce was a perfect compliment to the steak and I have never had my steak turn out so tender before. I don't know what it was, maybe slicing it against the grain? Anyway, delicious!",2007-01-22
78289,368594,5,1,"Hi Kit,
  We tried this recipe for lunch yesterday and it was oh-so-good.
We used heavy cream instead of half and half. My hubby loved it! We can't wait to try it out on some guests. Kit, you are a great cook! Keep up the good work and thanks for sharing,

78289,97780,5,1,We loved this.  It was easy enough for a weeknight but nice enough for company.  Used the Dijon mustard.  Followed the directions exactly as written and it turned out perfectly.  Everyone loved it -- in this family that is nothing short of a miracle.,2007-04-02
78289,220403,5,1,"Delicious!  I only made the sauce and used it to go along with grilled medallion steaks.  The thyme adds a really nice flavor to the sauce and DH and I enjoyed it very much!  It makes a generous portion, so we will happily use the leftovers tonight to top potatoes or maybe pork!  Thanks!",2007-04-03
78289,299685,4,1,"This dish had a nice flavor and I will likely make the sauce again.  But like another reviewer, I will probably use the sauce on grilled steaks next time.  I love rare meat and the steaks were perfect for me but a little rare for DH.  I used dijon mustard but might try the horseradish next time for more bite.  I also failed to use enough salt and pepper... my issue not the recipe's!",2007-07-31
78289,471937,5,1,thanks kittencal!  This was amazing.  My family kept oohing and ahhing as they ate.  I'll make this one over and over!,2008-03-11

78289,226863,5,1,"This was wonderful!  I followed the recipe as written, except....I added Cavender's Greek Seasoning to the mushroom/onion mix. I tripled the amount of horseradish because of personal preference!   I also sliced the steak into strips just before adding back to the skillet.  I just found that to be easier.  My steak was perfectly cooked at  2 minutes on each side, but I don't like an overcooked piece of steak!  I served this with a spinach/strawberry salad, garlic green beans, and a baked potato.  Next time, I will definitely serve some noodles or mashed potatoes to make use of the wonderful gravy this recipe makes.   I will also consider cooking the sirloin steak in the first step, with additional seasonings.  June in Pensacola is too hot for the grill, but this sirloin tasted wonderful right out of the skillet after 4 minutes!! This is a definite keeper!",2008-06-08
78289,372185,5,1,"We really enjoyed this recipe!  I followed the recipe as written, using horseradish.  The steaks were perfectly cooked... for my husband.  I like mine a medium, and I'd say they were more medium rare, so next time I would cook the steak a little longer.  I made with mashed potatoes and used the gravy over both the steaks and the potatoes.",2008-06-17
78289,594726,5,1,Wonderful!  I used deer backstrap instead of steak.  I did everything else the same.  Just loved it!,2008-10-14

78289,592157,5,1,I gotta give this one another 5 stars. It was so good! I left out the onions but did use the garlic as well as fresh thyme. Wonderful flavor and the steak came out just right.,2008-11-09
78289,1056391,5,1,"I made this last night and it made for one happy man!  Followed the recipe exactly as directed, with the exception of using thin cut T-bone steaks as they were what I had on hand, I was a little worried they'd be tough with frying as thin as they were, but they came out very tender.  Thanks again for posting!",2009-01-09
78289,126440,5,1,Very good and easy recipe.  I used a pre-made bacon burger and served over mashed potatoes.  Loved the horseradish in the sauce.,2009-02-12

78289,306797,5,1,"Oh, this was divine!  We loved the sauce & the steak came out nice & tender.  Served with Recipe #372602 & mashed potatoes for a lovely dinner on a cool evening.  Made for ZWT5 by a Hell's Kitchen Angel.",2009-05-31
78289,223854,5,1,"Hubby's most ordered meal when we go out to a bistro or pub is medium rare steak with mushroom sauce.  So I wanted to find a recipe to make for him tonight because he was working away and haven't seen him for a while.  I use this recipe for the sauce but cooked the steak using Recipe #293859.  I also used chicken stock instead of beef stock, so I could eat it as well (I don't eat red meat) and used lactose free cream so Little Miss (DD) would be able to eat it.  Hubby said it was very delicious meal.  Little Miss (DD) really enjoyed the meal.  I really enjoyed the sauce over a grilled chicken breast.  Served with saute potato and zucchini.   Thank you KITTENCAL",2009-09-01
78289,494783,4,1,"Sadly at 25 this was the first time I cooked a steak, (was vegan for yrs but married a carnivore) so I decided to make this for our anniversary. Over all it turned out pretty good for my first attempt. Sadly they were cheap steaks & had a lot of fat & the grvy made it hard to see& avoid. I thought the outside was browning (aka burnt) too fast so  I turned it down, prob too soon, so I had to cook it in the gravy longer than directed. The gravy was really good but the mushroom/onion mix seemed to stop making ""juices"" sooner than directed again. Possibly bcuz I didn't have enough mushrooms. I'm gonna attribute my few faults as an error on my part, but will def be making this one again!",2010-02-05
78289,415907,5,1,This was really good! I did not have the horseradish or Dijon mustard so I used a couple of splashes of Worcestershire! Turned out great! There was a lovely sauce so I served some rice with it to soak it up! Very good!,2010-03-03
78289,1542806,5,1,Great recipe.  I'm a novice but followed this recipe exactly and the family loved it.,2010-05-20
78289,805719,1,0,"I did not care much for this recipe. For those that are very into casseroles, I'm sure you'll be very at home with it. I would add a bit more salt, and perhaps some cooking wine to the sauce, maybe a bit of oregano to spice things up a bit. Otherwise, I thought it was a bit bland.",2010-06-14
78289,1506604,4,1,It was okay. Not the most visually appealing meal but it wasn't bad. I just ran out of onions so I substituted scallions. Also I did not even need to include salt. I used a good helping of grey pupon deli-horseradish mustard for the horseradish requirement. If I ever make this again I will definitely use less thyme and maybe chicken stock instead of beef broth. If you're one of those people who orders gravy steaks at diners then you will really like this.,2010-07-24
78289,452355,4,1,"This sauce recipe was really easy and had nice flavor.  It was a little thick for my taste.  I might add less flour next time.  Otherwise, we enjoyed it over Delmonico's.  Thanks!",2011-04-09

Unable to find either tagliatelle or prepared creme fraiche, I worked around those obstacles by using egg fettuccine and making my own Recipe #171932 . I was concerned that the sauce would break with boiling but the directions were right on - it was creamy and perfect. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!",2007-05-11

248955,8377,4,1,"Very delicate-tasting rice dish and so easy to put together. All of the ingredients were nicely balanced with none dominating the other. I love recipes like that. I didn't have cashews, so I subbed with pinenuts which are as sweet as cashews. I will make this often... it's easy, fast, and very good.",2008-08-30
248955,1206102,5,1,"Utterly amazing!  Wow.  I did not have whole cloves on hand, so cautiously added ground ones, and that was fine.

248955,2195710,5,1,"Very delicious recipe. I didn't have one bit of trouble making this dish for the first time. I did add a couple of teaspoons of ghee and substituted low salt mixed nuts instead of only cashews because I love fried peanuts and almonds, as well, in my pulau. No one in my family likes raisins, especially cooked raisins, so I omitted that. Although, I did cook the recipe on the stove, you can also cook it in a rice cooker after you fry everything for even fluffier rice. Overall, a good Nepali recipe that is very authentic tasting.",2012-02-27

Good, but I bet better using white rice.Thanks for sharing the recipe.",2016-08-25

Super tastey way to use up a little of this and that. In my case I followed the basic mix, but then veered off tossing in a handfull of left over frozen shrimp, seared beef, peas, diced baby carrots, diced sweet onion and minced cilantro.  Yummo!
Didn't have light soy sauce on hand, but used the Tamari Soy I had on hand--without adding any more salt (Tamari had a lot of sodium).
Result: Delish! I like my fried rice smokin' hot, so I added a dash of cayenne to my own serving, but left the rest fire-safe for others.

Next time I would add 1/2 pound sausage and 1/2 pound of ground beef. I did omit the mushrooms as I wasn't sure if they all liked them or not. I also added a lot more cheese then called for. I didnt measure, I just dumped as we love cheese. I thought it could use more seasoning also but the kids didn't say anything about that. Made for Fall PAC 2008.",2008-10-06

Your directions are easy to follow and the end result is a creamy soup with a distinct and strong celery taste and just a hint of leek and garlic.
Next time I think Ill reduce the amount of celery used and increase the amount of leek as I think that way the soup would taste even better for me.
Being a vegetarian, I used veggie stock in place of the chicken stock.

This is a really yummy side dish. I did have to add more salt and also some black pepper as there were little seasonings and I think next time I'll add some roasted garlic for even more flavor. Will definitely make again. :),2008-08-17
317320,383346,5,1,"For us, there is no need of more seasoning.  Cause I roasted the onion in butter for 9 minutes.  And I used 1 onion.  I think that the golden brown onion gives this dish most of the flavors.  Without it, I can't imagine it.  I cooked my potatoes and carrots in the microwave for about 19 minutes at high power.

I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the onion and, after the carrot and potato were cooked and thoroughly drained (I started cooking them 10 minutes before sauteing the onion and garlic), I removed the onions and garlic from the pan, added a tad more butter (about a teaspoon) and about half a teaspoon of brown sugar, and then added the carrots and potatoes to the pan and kept stirring them for the full 90 seconds or so they were in there.  In step two, while mashing the carrots (I used baby carrots) and potatoes, I added a pinch of cinnamon and a teaspoon of honey to the Greek yoghurt which I used in place of the sour cream.

The streusel never did behave like streusel, it was more like thick peanut butter frosting even after I added almost half again as much flour and brown sugar, so I spread it across the top of the batter as best I could.  After baking, the streusel fell off when the bread was touched, and I had to sprinkle it over the slices after they were buttered to make it stay.  Both the banana and the peanut butter tastes were almost nonexistent in the finished product.  The only thing I did differently from recipe as written was to leave out the nuts, as I didn't have any.

I used 8 chicken breast tenders. The flour mixture seemed like too little, and the panko seemed like too much. I suggest decreasing the panko by 1/2 c. and increasing the flour mixture by half (not doubling it, but 1 1/2 recipes of it). I doubled the sauce, and it turned out to be the perfect amount for 8 chicken tenders. I baked mine at 400 degrees F, flipping the chicken once, and they were done in about 18 minutes. We had Ranch dressing with ours (personal preference), but the taste of the chicken is excellent. It would probably even be really good without coating with the Buffalo-style sauce.

I had about 14-1/2 ounces of chicken which made about 10 pieces. I think next time I will leave the cayenne out of the spice/flour mixture. These were spicy....but yummy! I doubled the sauce too - had a little left if someone wanted to add extra sauce to theirs. I will also add a little honey to the sauce mixture next time as it cuts the vinegar and heat from the sauce. Used Frank's Red Hot - 'cuz it's the very best!

I agree with a previous review that stated the ratios were off- I had 2 normal-sized chicken breasts that I sliced into tenders; the flour mix was the right amount, but the panko was WAY too much.

After the chicken was cooked, I used a silicone pastry brush to completely coat the chicken in the sauce and put it back in the over for a few more minutes.

It says to combine them in a shallow bowl, but not sure if they are to be mixed with the egg wash, the breadcrumbs or at another step in the recipe.  However, I went my own way and used a popular green can of Louisiana made Cajun Seasoning in the flower and in the bread crumbs and it came out great.  I also used a bottled sauce to save that few extra minutes at the end.  I would like to try the sauce though in the future as it contains 3 of my 4 favorite things in it (Hot Sauce, Worster and butter)  If only it had bacon in it.

347136,2794129,5,1,"FINALLY!  A recipe that works and tastes great.  We&#039;ve made 3 or 4 other recipes and they just don&#039;t work.  This is a good balance of flavor - not too spicy.  They came out of the oven crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I think the egg whites and the panko are the key to getting the coating just right. (Much better than breadcrumbs.)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My suggestions:&lt;br/&gt;1) Use paper towels to dry the tenders before dredging.  &lt;br/&gt;2) There never seems to be enough dredge or egg wash.  I doubled both for 5 small chicken breasts and still ran out.  Also, have more panko on hand.   &lt;br/&gt;3) Line the cooking sheet with parchment paper.  &lt;br/&gt;4) Be sure to give them enough space on the cooking sheet.  At least 1 inch between them.  That allows the steam to escape and keeps them crispy.  Do them in batches if you must.  &lt;br/&gt;5) These need a sauce, but we have at least one in our family who doesn&#039;t like the spicy buffalo.  So, we serve these with the buffalo sauce on the side, along with BBQ.  That way each person can control the flavor and spiciness. (It makes the kids happy.)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am so glad that I found this recipe.  It&#039;s a keeper!",2013-04-21

I ended up putting the vanilla in the  main dough and the rum in with the cherries.  I doubled the recipe for I was trying to make enough cookies to share with friends and family.  When I did I found 6 cups of flour to be way too much so only added 5.  Even then the dough was very stiff and hard to mix.  I found the dough with the pistachio nuts had a hard time staying cohesive and would crumble when I would try to slice it.  I would suggest cutting the amount down at least by a third.  In the midst of all these issues I was determined to make them work on account of cost I invested in the some of the items.  In the end I was able to recoup and got them baked, but I don't really think they have a great deal of flavor.",2007-12-22

15709,1495589,4,1,"I made these cookies last year and this year, and I tried to improve them this year. Last year I really liked the look, but the flavor was not intense enough. First, I wonder if any of the other folks who thought the flavor was lacking might have forgotten the salt. It is not listed under ingredients but does turn up near the bottom. Also, there is a discrepancy in the amount of milk needed at the top and in the directions. Read that carefully. What I did was add a tiny bit more vanilla, maybe another half tsp, increased the salt to a half tsp, added a tsp cherry extract to the cherry dough, and used about 2 tsps of rum in the pistachio dough. I also added a few finely chopped chocolate chips to the chocolate dough. That sounds like a lot of changing up, but they are more intense in flavor this time. I like them enough to do them this way yearly. Another tip I would really suggest is to lean toward the longer chilling time and sharpen your knife before slicing. I chilled them the entire 24 hours this year and have not had problems with the slicing at all.",2009-12-23

Any cookie with cream cheese in it is worth trying in MY book. :-) They definitely burned on the bottom, didn't look at all 'done' on the top and the taste was just 'off'. Maybe I'm not too fond of the orange/cream cheese/chocolate combo. (?) But I read the other reviews today and would agree completely with AprilShowers.

I replaced the Bisquick with Fiber One pancake mix, which did increase the carbs slightly. However, I struggle to get enough of those in as well. 1/2 cup of Fiber One mix contains 36 grams of carbs, as I doubled the recipe to be sure to get 2 grain and 6 protein exchanges (4 with 1 cup cottage cheese, plus the two eggs).

When I saw the price at the grocer for 2 pounds of fresh spinach I choked!

That being said, I probably won't make this again. I did use the basic flavors of this recipe to make a lovely squash saute a few nights later: a little olive oil (not a lot like this recipe), chopped garlic and onion, red pepper, and squash sauteed until slighlty caramelized in a skillet on the stove. Took hardly any time and produced similar results. Husband even thought that it was better this way. Glad I tried this recipe though. It did make a fair number of servings and made for a fabulous potluck dish.",2005-06-05

I used an extra pepper as I like roasted peppers as well as using a little more flour to dust the zucchini as I found 2 tsp. was not enough for that quantity but otherwise made the recipe as written.

There are many steps and lots of prep work needed to pull it off. (I had no roasted red peppers, so I even had to take the time to do that!) But, it is a keeper- I'll place it in my ""fancy-schmancy"" file because it really is quite lovely. (I recomend sticking to the ""grated"" parmesan recommendation...

I halved this recipe, and it came out beautifully. I used about half of the crab meat that went into the crock with the other ingredients. At the end of cooking time, I took the lump crab meat and folded that in ever so gently, so the large lumps remained. I served on large tortilla chips with a little piece of crispy lettuce on top of the chip with a dab of crab mixture on top. Topped off with some of the chunked jalapeno and a dash of Old Bay. This was grand, cookiedog! Thanks for saving my kitchen from the sweltering heat. Made for *ZWT4* June 2008.",2008-06-22

I bought one of those mini crock pots and it fitted about 1-1/2 cups, so it only worked well for a group of four.  I will use the rest of the dip for a family gathering this week.

Being on unfamiliar territory, I made these falafel exactly to the recipe except for omitting the cayenne pepper (a personal taste preference; I added some freshly ground black pepper instead). And for ease of making, I made them in mini silicon muffin pans.  Truly delicious, healthy and really quick to make.  We've enjoyed them in sandwiches and with salads.

The spices and aroma are outstanding. The vinegarette drizzled over the burger topped with homemade Tzatziki sauce is delectable. It really reminds me of a kibee sandwich which my family loves to eat.

I omitted the salt from the vinegarette, and the seeds from the cucumber before cutting it into small chunks. I used oat bran pita bread grinded in the food processor as the bread crumbs for my low glycemic diet.

Lamb is sometimes hard to find in my area, but I will drive out of my way just to get some to make this recipe. Lean ground sirloin is a good choice for beef.

After cooking the sausages, the ""gyro meat"" can be sliced thinly and browned in a skillet, then stuffed into pitas. It is also easy to freeze any extra sausages.

The cake is very moist and dense.  It is not overly sweet, which is great for a coffee cake.  It tasted very old-fashioned!  My husband loved the chopped almond topping.  I thought the almonds just kind of sat on top of the cake and didn't really incorporate well as a topping.  I felt like the almonds would've been better if the topping had been a streusal topping with slivered almonds, but didn't think of that until after I had already baked the cake.  I think this is just a personal preference thing and others might really like the almonds on top, just as the recipe states.  I dusted the individual cake servings with powdered sugar; which gave each piece a very nice presentation.  My cake took quite a bit longer to bake than the 1 hour specified in the instructions.

I used flatbread instead of country bread and omitted the arugula, but wish I hadn't because the balsamic/oil made the bread sort of mushy, which I didn't really like - I think the leaves would provide a bit of a barrier between the bread and the oil, so I'll include it next time.

I was unable to access the aragula, so I used something called landcress, which is a relation to watercress, only had about 1 cups worth of green matter, which is a shame, but what can you do?

The entire pan was gone within 2 hours, and that wasn't even for a party or anything, just people wandering through our office area. I did have a little trouble with the crust part (of my own doing). The mixture seemed a bit too dry and crumbly to stick together when I used the original 1/2 cup butter, so I added a couple more tbs. of butter. Apparently, I added enough butter for the crust to start trying to become a cake when baked. I should have used a deeper pan after that, because the crust bubbled up, went overboard onto the oven floor, and created a crusty mess. My fault, no big deal though. They were nice and rich, no one knew that the crust was a cake mix because it was so fudgy and brownie-like,and they were pretty simple to make. I'll be making these again (in a deeper pan, of course)! Thanks for posting! Oh, and I omitted the nuts due to nut allergies at the office, and used those new caramel swirl chips in place of the butterscotch. I'll use butterscotch next time, since I recently found some Guittard butterscotch chips on sale (much better tasting than the Nestle's, IMO). Thanks again!  :)",2005-10-02

I don't have the big jelly roll pan so I tried it in a 9.5 x 13 pan and it was fine.

I don't want to post mine because it is so similar.
There are just a few differences though:
We add Miracle Whip to taste and sometimes a little milk to thin if it's too thick.  We don't add dill, sugar or salt.
Hmmmm dill might be a good idea.
Best to add salt individually once served so it doesn't get too runny.  I love fresh ground pepper and lots of it!

In fact, it should rate 5 stars, but after 2 hours' chilling the cucumber was shedding liquid and thinning the salad dressing. A keeper -- all I'd tweak next time is to salt the cucumbers beforehand to draw out some liquid. The taste was perfect. And may I suggest, this salad is perfect with spicy meat -- I happened to make a Moroccan-type meatball from a Zaar recipe, and it complemented each other perfectly. It would be perfect with a curry as well. Thanks, Parsley, this a great way to use this salad veggie! I used my food processor to slice the cucumber as thinly as possible. And I forgot to say: as I was using lemon juice in my main dish, I had enough left over, so I used lemon juice in the dressing instead of vinegar.",2011-02-07

It&#039;s okay for the salad to be a bit wet with water, but you have to have the sour with the sweet otherwise, it tastes like any other middle American salad (I&#039;m thinking salads with marshmallows and all that). Also, more salt needs to be added. But overall, cut the sugar to 3T and add about 1/2 cup of vinegar. Also add 1T of dill and you will have something that more resembles what they do in Finland.

I sugared the pan after spraying it with Pam And that added a marvelous crispiness to the crust which enhanced the very moist, tender  and scrumptious.

It's not a really sweet cake and I wouldn't add any more because it perfect as is in the sweet dept, and it's spice is just right too. It really does remind me of the cakes that my grandmother use to make when I was young.

I also like all the ingreds for this condiment, so I splurged and bought a Vidalia sweet onion (all I found), though I love Walla Walla's, too).  I basically changed the serving size to 1/2 cup, which used 1 onion.  My onion was closer to large so I ended up with approx 1 - 1 1/2 cups worth.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I made last night and put in fridge for this evening's dinner.  Mine turned out to look exactly like Charmie777's photo.  I tasted the relish on its own and had my bf take a taste.  I thought it was pretty good, nice crunch, good flavor, not too overpowering. though I was worried it smelled vinegary.  Bf said succinctly, ""Oniony.""

They were quite soggy and didn't want to hold together.  I'm fear perhaps I did not 'drain' the zucchini properly or something, as the 'batter' was very runny.  I did salt the grated zucchini and let it 'sweat' for about 30 minutes before squeezing off as much water as I could and adding to the mixing bowl.  Judging by the photos posted, others did not have this problem....so I may try again and give some extra effort to 'drying' the zucchini.  If not, I may incorporate these flavors into a zucchini casserole or veggie side dish.  Again, the blend of ingredients created a perfect flavor.  Thank you for sharing.",2009-08-16

324023,955850,5,1,"I loved the consistancey of these biscotti so much the first time I made them (as did everyone I served them to) that I now use it as my base biscotti recipe and just substitute different flavorings and ""chunky things"" when I want a change from the Cranberry and Chocolate (which is delicious!!!).  I do find I add a lot of flour during the kneading process because it's very sticky, probably up to 3/4c, but they come out great every time, Thanks Sydney!!!",2008-09-24

I found that the dough was quite dry and that I had to press the logs into shape to keep the dough together, so quite the different experience as the other review.

They did come together easily; after reading the other reviews I held back about a half cup of flour;  I added a little of it, but not much. I found it was important to really work this dough together. I would increase the amount of almond extract and add some cinnamon to brighten up the overall flavor. I was out of semisweet bits so subbed a chopped up chunk of Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate with almonds.",2010-11-18
324023,1742188,4,1,"So i tried this for my first attempt making biscotti. I left out the cranberries and used white choclate chips instead. The most frustrating part, was how crumbly they were, near the end I added 2more tablespoons of oil to help it try and stick together. I will probably subtitute the oil for butter next time, I also added some unsweetend baking cocoa and cinnamon to the mix for more flavor. Even though I had crumbly logs the taste was great with the chocolate and cinnamon.",2010-11-24
211441,70073,5,1,"Wonderful recipe for meatballs and spaghetti sauce. The only change I made was to omit the pork bones because I couldn't find them in the store. This recipe has just the right amount of garlic and seasonings. I added fresh chopped parsley at the end of cooking and served it with spaghetti cooked by using recipe #30358, and sprinkled each serving with grated parmesan cheese. The remaining sauce was frozen in meal-size portions. I think the meatballs and a little of the sauce would be great on a submarine bun with some melted mozzarella cheese on top, and served with a side of french fries and cole slaw too.",2007-11-07

I used combination of the ground pork/ground beef, and when cooking I took special note of the bit of water in the bottom of the pan to prevent the meatballs from browning to much and to quickly. This was really nice especially with the addition of seasoning salt- I use a no salt brand, it gave a real nice taste. The ""gravy"" was started from the tomatoes I had frozen whole from the summer, and I swear you could almost smell the garden again after fixing this gravy. Everything was perfect, seriously I wouldn't change really anything because this was perfect, bubbling away, and bringing me back memories of hot summer breezes.

I used a combination of dried apricots, dates, and a cranberry, cherry, and blueberry mix. Used Brandy and the zest of 3/4 of an orange. Since I didn&#039;t have the recommended decor I opted for slivers of blanched almonds as little stems. The taste is fresh and rich, not too sweet, and great to accompany many holiday snacks and dishes. These would taste especially nice with a tangy, semi soft cheese. They just seem like a treat French families would nibble on at a Christmas party by a warm fire. I plan on trying this with different fruit combinations, like pear, apricots, golden raisins, lime, and sparkling wine. And, hopefully the candied ginger will make it in  .

I made this the traditional way but not with any meat. DH also said his family mixes theirs but we liked it layered mixed is just easier. Layering it I had to cook it differently. Here is what I did: I cooked the onion in some oil in my cast iron frying pan and then added the fresh dill and some sea salt to taste. I added this to the drained soaked mung (mash) beans with some water and cooked them until tender. There was still a little liquid left so I retained it for the rice. I cooked white basmati rice in some boiling salted water for exactly 8 minutes and then drained and put into a greased pan to set in a low oven once layered with the bean mixture. I sprinkled some of the left over liquid on top and covered the pan with aluminum foil and left it in the oven until done. I will definitely will make this again and again.",2010-04-14

There was just a little broth left in the bottom of the crockpot after the barley was done cooking.  It was so rich in the flavors of the stew. After searing the meat I deglazed the pan with the beef broth.  I did not want to lose  any of that extra flavor.  I used 8 ounces of frozen green beans not canned.  I thought since a can holds about 7 ounces of liquid, why not just use frozen then.  I was glad I made that change but I'll put 12 ounces in next time.   Cabernet Sauvignon was the wine I used.

Tomato Sauce: as written, but I dehydrated my own tomatoes the day before, then re-hydrated them as directed. Next time I might increase onion and put a little Italian seasoning in sauce too. But it was very good as written. Pesto:  I used 'my' pesto of spinach, basil, asparagus, lemon juice and garlic.

116992,117781,4,1,"These were pretty good! They definitely tasted better the next day. We thought the filling was too sweet, but the cookie was just right. For some reason, the first day you could really taste the salt in the cookie, rather than it just enhancing the chocolate flavor, but by the next day it was less noticeable.  I had a little problem with the dough. I followed the directions exactly, but the dough was more like cake batter, very loose and there was no way I could have rolled it into balls so I used a small scoop instead. It worked fine. I roughly measured the scoops to be an inch and a half but still the recipe only yielded me 16 total whoopie pies, which was no where near the 3 dozen I needed and thought I would get. I suppose if I make the scoops even smaller I would have had more, but then it would have been a mini-whoopie pie.  I am going to keep the cookie portion of the recipe and see if I can figure out how to make a fluffier, less sweet filling. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",2006-06-08

I felt the filling was a TAD too runny for the cookies. Everytime I sandwiched it, the filling squished out from the sides or the top cookie slide off. I put the filling in the freezer for a while and that helped some. I think I'm going to try the lil deebie recipe filling for these. Now about the cookie part! It's a keeper! I LOVED them! I forgot to add milk but they still came out great and the dough was firm and easy to work with. I think I will press them down more so the cookies won't be so thick. I love the chocolatey taste!!!

116992,651118,3,0,"I thought these cookies had excellent flavor, but either I really screwed up or the recipe needs some serious tweaking. The cookie part turned out really fudgy, more like a brownie than a cake (I personally liked it). I dumped probably a 1/2 cup more flour into the dough before I could begin to roll them. I also added a whole cup to the filling before I could get it to even begin to stay on the cookie. I didn't want to add too much sugar and make them too sweet, so I cut the cookies in half and then frosted them (worked pretty well). I had the best success scooping out the middle and (using a piping bag) stuffed each cookie. These turned out the best. Great starting point, but definately could be improved.",2007-12-31
116992,359820,5,1,"I gave this recipe 5 stars for three reasons- they were easy to make, they were way healthier then any other recipe I could find and they tasted great! The dough was rather stiff at the end of mixing. So, they rolled out into balls just fine. I made the cookie part the night before. I made the filling, I used a Seven Minute Frosting recipe, the day of the party. I assembled and refrigerated a few hours before the party. They held together just fine. My only complaint would be the quantity of servings stated. That was way off, like others have said. I rolled my dough into 1 inch balls and flattened them pretty well. I ended up with 40 two inch wide cookies. I needed 40 'pies' for my party. So, I used a serrated knife and sliced each one open, like a hamburger bun. Then filled them. They were really the perfect size ( see my photo with three pies and a quarter on a plate for reference) just a couple of bites. I just had a Whoopie Pie for the first time last week in a restaurant.

These seemed more ""N.H. style"" whoopie pie to me than a ""MA. style"" like I grew up on, but that's the joy in the regional recipes to me. I used  light olive oil and skim milk the first time, canola oil and 2 % milk the second, and couldn't tell the difference. The filling is sweeter and softer than I like personally, (another regional thing),  but easily adjusted.  I used a cookie scoop and didn't bother with flattening them down, they spread out enough on their own, and I'm lazy that way. thanks for sharing this recipe, Parsley.",2009-02-22

116992,323722,4,1,"Not being familiar with the Whoopie Pie, but having heard of it, I decided to give these a try.

The cookie mix looked, smelled and felt like really stiff cake batter.  I followed the recipe and there was no way this was going to turn into rollable balls.  So I used my mini-disher to scoop out small blobs, which spread nicely without being pressed down.  The cookies themselves are bland, actually.

I read comments about the filling being too sweet, so I heated the milk slightly and added some coffee grounds to it and let them steep.  The resulting coffee flavoured frosting is still quite sweet, but works very well with the bland cookies, improving their chocolate flavour.

Overall these are pretty good.  I wouldn't consider making the filling as is.  It needs some kind of bitterness to balance it.

Oh, and I doubled the whole recipe and have enough filling for another double batch of cookies.  Or a layer cake!",2010-01-22

116992,1449637,5,1,"Pure delight!  We&#039;ve made this recipe about half a dozen times now, sometimes with regular unbleached flour and sometimes with a white whole-wheat flour, and we actually like it slightly better with the whole-wheat.  We substitute almond milk for the milk and use all shortening instead of butter because of lactose issues around here.  Have to warn you though -- the almond milk makes this already sticky recipe even stickier.  I still haven&#039;t figured out how to flatten the pies.  But the almond milk gives the pies a subtle nutty flavor that&#039;s really very appealing.  We eat these &quot;lower fat&quot; &quot;healthier&quot; whoopee pies until we can&#039;t stuff any more in, and now I&#039;m making them for our son&#039;s school events too.  People love &#039;em.

Like the others that have added reviews, I cut mine in half and filled them with green Irish cream buttercream frosting (yep, you guessed it, these were for St.Paddy&#039;s Day). After being stored in an airtight container overnight, they turned so incredibly delicious and moist! Definitely a winner in my books!

Unfortunately, I had a few difficulties making this recipe. The dough is very wet, and doesn't really knead without the addition of a whole lot of extra flour. When I mixed it up, I had a great drop biscuit dough, but had to add about 1/2 cup more flour to get a sliceable scone dough.  I also couldn't figure out how to cut the circle into nine pieces without doing a bit of geometry, so I went with eight. The ginger is an absolutely genius touch, and the mascarpone cream is so good, it didn't really need the cherry pieces suggested. I decided to leave it plain, and enjoyed every bite.",2008-08-22

The flavors work beautifully together (cherry and almond, yumm) and make a that would be suited to family and guests alike. The cheese and cream spread (I didn't add cherries) will make the most decadence loving guest smile with delight. I did need to bake them an extra 7 mins to get a blush of gold but all ovens differ and I don't find that to be a recipe flaw in any way. Made for Photo Tag.",2008-09-09

Since there were no fresh cherries available, I used canned ones, drained them very well, reduced the sugar a bit (I used normal brown sugar) and proceeded as stated in the recipe. The scones browned very nicely and tasted heavenly! Not overly sweet, fruity and flaky (but not dry). I can honestly say that this is one of the best scones recipes Ive ever tried!

198408,500860,4,1,"BEAUTIFUL presentation. A bit lacking in flavor for me (I used an aniseed type vodka, it's all I had in the house) and a bit on the watery side. But looks just BEAUTIFUL.

This could be rectified by doubling the amount of smoked salmon and using a veggie broth/chicken broth or more flavorful substitute. Perhaps some garlic tossed into the onion sautee would help. I don't know, but it was still missing something for me.

Note that the fish will get opaque/white in the cooking process. Gives it a bit of a meaty flavor. 

I can't help but think this would be delicious with clams. Since I keep kosher, I can't try that though. But it seems like the right consistancy for that. This may have been closer to 3.5 stars for me on flavor, but a definate 5 star presentation.

65870,6357,2,0,"I made this using low-fat milk and had this as a light snack today. This is very simple, but too simple for my taste. I felt it was missing something, maybe some chocolate or coffee? So, I added 1 cup of coffee(sweetened with 1 tsp. sugar) to this. I felt it still needed more sugar, so I added 1 more tsp. Even then it wasn't perfect. I didn't have any malted milk powder on hand or I would have added some of it to this(I love Ovaltine, so I would use that). If one can afford to put on a few pounds, then how about adding some Hershey's Chocolate syrup or Hershey's Strawberry Syrup to this and some sliced strawberries? Might make it mighty and very tasty. ",2003-07-02
65870,49499,5,1,"This is one of my all time favorites--my mom used to serve it for dessert and we loved it.  Now my kids love it too!  Thanks for reminding me, Kree.",2003-07-04
65870,68715,5,1,I had forgotten all about this until I saw it here. My grandmother used to make this for me when I was little. Very tasty! Thanks for the memory.,2003-07-08
65870,35140,5,1,"I love this with Splenda.  It seems like such a treat, but it's so low calorie, low fat and so good for you.  I thought I was just weird.",2003-07-14
65870,64583,5,1,I love this!  My mom used to make it for me when I was younger; it's comfort food! I've made it for my sons and they enjoy it too!  Makes a nice bedtime snack for them.  ,2003-07-15
65870,340516,4,1,I tried this as a breakfast treat and it is absolutely delicious and very simple. I will most definately have to make this more for breakfast. Thanks the recipe^^,2006-08-11
65870,352538,4,1,Made this way this is quite nice but it doesn't totally measure up to the way my mom made it when I was a kid.  Brown sugar and heavy cream instead of white sugar and soya milk.  Now that is a treat that is really comfort food.,2006-09-17
65870,6836,5,1,"Seeing this recipe sure brought back memories of my childhood!  I used to have this quite often as a bedtime snack when I was little, except that my Mom or Dad would sprinkle the bananas with Nestle's Strawberry Quik instead of sugar, before adding the milk.  I'm not even sure if they still make the strawberry-flavored Quik drink mix anymore ... but I just might have to look for it now!  LOL  Thanks for posting an all-time favorite treat.  -M =)",2006-09-26
65870,437679,5,1,"This was childhood comfort food for me as well, and I admit it, I still enjoy it from time to time.  Sometimes I'll use cinnamon or vanilla sugar just to mix things up a bit.  The simple things can truly be the most satisfying.",2007-03-11
65870,562793,5,1,yum yum bubblegum!!,2008-01-26
65870,227652,4,1,simple & yummy. i sprinkled the top with cinnamon & used a Splenda pkt for half a banana. Thank u for sharing!,2008-01-27
65870,345569,4,1,"Simple, maybe -- but it never would have occurred to me to do this!  I sprinkled a small banana with about half a packet of Splenda, and used light original soymilk.  I think I'd go easier on the Splenda next time, or use a less-ripe banana, because it was a bit TOO sweet for my taste.  Thanks for posting!!",2008-09-05
65870,107904,5,1,This is how my father loved to eat bananas.  We use milk and sugar or Splenda.  It's sooooo good!,2008-11-04
65870,1169153,5,1,"THANK YOU for rescuing me when I have the munchies! This is perfect. The bananas are sweet enough for me, so I omit the sugar. I also like to microwave for 10 seconds- warm, sweet, delicious, low-calorie comfort food. Thank you!",2009-02-26
65870,486680,4,1,And i thought that I was the only one that did this!  I used to make this for a dessert or supper when I was a child.  I just did the bananas and milk tho.  So simple but so yum.  :),2009-03-05
65870,891454,5,1,"this is excellent, try using honey instead of sugar, and warm it in the microwave for a few seconds, simply awsome",2010-01-05
65870,503743,5,1,"I love this to ! My Mom got us started and I've never forgotten. Sometimes I use brown sugar, and can't wait to try honey. Thanks for posting :)",2010-02-02
65870,490200,5,1,"How easy is this?! I used milk but the vanilla flavor sounded so good, I added a dab of vanilla extract too. Microwaved for 12 seconds. My preschoolers loved it! In fact my 3 year old son said he was AMAZED. Wow.",2010-02-03
65870,306116,5,1,ate this all the time as a kid.,2010-02-04
65870,1320105,5,1,I've never had this before; nor have I ever heard of it.  Thanks for posting this simple snack.  It is delicious and healthy.  I think I will try this on my kids for an afterschool snack.   I did use Splenda and I microwaved it for 15 seconds.  Very yummy!,2010-03-24
65870,2398530,5,1,this is very easy even for my class mates and other students in my school.im going to try it out myself soon.,2012-09-11
65870,2001804564,5,1,"Made this for my sister, she loved it. She's 4 and picky, just like me. While making I &quot;tried&quot; (ate) a few.",2017-11-18
98869,6357,5,1,This cake was soooooooo delicious and soo good!!! I guess I will have to work very hard on the treadmill just to burn the amount of cake I had;) Thanks a bunch for posting!,2004-09-01
98869,60992,5,1,"This is an AWESOME cake! I was very worried at first as the batter barely worked together before I put the fruit in, but after I put in 3 pears and 1 granny smith apple it was just fine. It was done in exactly 45minutes and the topping....OH MY!!! After I finished baking the topping it looked like little pools of carmel on top. Dh went crazy, we love this cake very much and I will be serving it often.",2004-09-17
98869,92385,5,1,"This is a great cake in the  coffeecake/snackcake genre (my step-daughter was even eating it for breakfast).  My husband doesn't usually like ""fruity"" desserts, but he loved this one; I think the caramel topping had alot to do with it ;) I made this with 4 gala apples, next time I'll try the pears. Thanks for posting !",2004-09-22
98869,104295,5,1,"Yes, I'd say pretty darn awesome!  Wow.  I doubled this and baked it in 4 8x8 pans.  (I want 3 as gifts for my 5 year old's teachers.  And I needed 1 to try to make sure it was ok to give them!)  I had HUGE Granny Smith apples and each was 2 cups of chopped apple.  I used skim milk and, for the first time in a long time, actually used white flour.  (I almost never keep it in the house anymore.)  I think this would be fabulous with whole wheat pastry flour as it is already dark with all the wonderful spices.  I was worried that the tartness of the apple would be a problem.  It was not at all.  And the glaze is amazing.  Not low fat but definitely worth it.  Thanks for such a wonderful cake!  ",2004-11-04
98869,89831,5,1,"Yes, awesome is the perfect word to describe this wonderful moist cake! It really deserves more than a five star rating. I made this cake using half and half in place of milk and used fresh pears, and cut down the sugar a bit. The caramel topping was just to die for on the cake. I baked mine in my air convection oven at 325 degrees, and was done in 40 minutes. I can't wait to make this cake again, it was just delicious! Sarahsmomi, thank you so much for sharing another winner!...Kitten:)",2004-11-26
98869,35635,5,1,"YUMMY!!! The cake would have been nice by itself but the sauce makes it truly delicious! I made mine with a combo of apples and pears that I needed to use up. As someone else suggested, I reduced the white sugar in the cake (I used 1/2 cup instead of 1). I left the brown sugar alone because I like brown sugar in recipes with fruit. Thanks sarahsmomi, this one really deserves all the 5 stars it has!",2005-08-28
98869,239788,5,1,"I make this cake for a family reunion. Everyone, even the ladies who have cooked and baked for years, asked for this recipe. My new son in law made the topping, he added a dash of cinnamon. It was so wonderful. I made more topping and put it on cheesecake also. YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY ",2005-09-06
98869,189643,5,1,"Hands down the best apple cake I've EVER had!!! Incredibly moist, and the caramel topping is delicious too. This just became the only recipe I'll use for apple cake. Thanks!",2005-09-15
98869,133174,5,1,This cake is so moist and delicious.  I reduced the recipe in half and baked it in a 9 x 9 inch pan.  For the white sugar I used Splenda which resulted in less cooking time.  The apples were a combination of red and yellow delicious.  As stated the cake is very moist.  I look forward to making it with pears.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.,2005-09-15
98869,115758,5,1,This cake was Fab served straight from the oven with lashings of cream! The caramel topping sets this cake apart from the ordinary.I made as stated in the recipe but would next time slightly reduce the sugar content.Thanks for sharing. ,2005-09-17
98869,18391,5,1,An excellent recipe! Loved by everyone! I made it using pears .. thanks for sharing!,2005-09-18
98869,229052,5,1,"Everyone loved this cake.  I followed the recipe exactly as posted and used apples.

",2005-09-28
98869,237655,5,1,I made it 2 nights ago and it was so fast to make! I think I put white sugar in the toping - an oversight but it was still delicious!,2005-09-30
98869,64934,5,1,This was wonderful!  I followed the recipe as stated using Macintosh apples.  The topping really gave the cake a great taste.  This was so easy to make and will definitely be made again...many times!  Thanks Sarahsmomi!,2005-10-06
98869,187128,5,1,Oh this is sooooo good. I couldn't resist taking a corner out to taste it. I especially like the lovely caramel topping. I used 1/2  cup cream and 1/2 cup milk. Added cinnamon to the topping. This cake will surely go into my fall rotation.,2005-10-09
98869,146486,5,1,This cake is awesome!  I used red delicious apples and I doubled the caramel topping which made the cake extra moist.  ,2005-10-15
98869,85873,5,1,Apples & pears are in season here. I used apples this time. Looking forward to trying the pears. This is a wonderful recipe! My family loved the carmel topping. Thank you I will be making this often during the winter.,2005-10-18
98869,169969,5,1,This cake is outstanding!! Wonderfully moist and totally delicious! I am not usually a fan of cooked apples - but this recipe was right on! I will make this one again!!! Thanks Leslie!,2005-10-18
98869,80937,5,1,Wonderful flavor. So moist and full of apples. Next time I will add walnuts for more flavor and texture. ( I would add walnuts to mashed potatoes if I thought I could get away with it!) I used half recipe for cake in a 9 in round cake pan. Baked as directed and it was perfect. I did a whole recipe for the topping.,2005-10-19
98869,229800,5,1,This was a great tasting cake! I really enjoyed it! It was even better the next day in my lunch!,2005-10-21
98869,107890,4,1,"This was super easy to make and my family enjoyed it with french vanilla ice cream which was really sinful!  Next time, I would double the topping recipe (probably poke the top with holes too to let the topping dribble down into the cake) and cut down bake time as I found at 40 mins, it turned really dark on the bottom.",2005-10-24
98869,83093,5,1,"This was delicious made with fresh juicy pears!  I made a few subs: soy milk, Egg Beaters, whole wheat pastry flour & Splenda pourable for half the white sugar.  It baked up perfectly just as listed - 45 minutes at 350.  The nibbling began as soon as it came out of the oven.  Thanks!",2005-10-24
98869,226066,5,1,"Delicious!  Very easy and very fast to make!  Next time, I will poke a few holes in the cake so that the topping gets more evenly into the cake.",2005-10-24
98869,290298,5,1,"Yummmy 
i used half oil half apple sauce and subed gelatin for the eggs(only because i had non) and these turned out fantastic-thankyou so much for sharing this great recipe",2009-02-19
98869,184723,0,0,My husband loved this cake but my little boy and I weren't too fond of it.  It seemed like it needed something.  If I make this again I will definitely double the topping as another reviewer suggested and add a bit more cinnamon or something.  ,2005-10-30
98869,121185,4,1,"I cut both sugars in half and subbed 1/2 whole wheat flour.  With that said, this was way overdone - if I make this again I'll only cook it for 35-40 minutes before topping it with the topping!  I did poke holes in the cake but there was almost not enought to cover the whole cake - it just barely made it - so next time I would make more of the topping.  It ended up not very sweet (which we liked) and it worked well as a breakfast treat.  My kids actually thought it was bread and not ""cake"".",2005-11-01
98869,134011,5,1,This is the 3rd time I have made this recipe.  It is so easy & I love the fact that I don't have to cream butter to make a nice cake.  Very yummy and a good way to use up the apples that keep coming home un-eaten from the kids school lunch boxes.,2006-01-25
98869,58562,5,1,"OH MAN THIS WAS SOOOOO GOOD! Almost like a bread pudding. So amazing!!! I used canned pears which turned out great! I was very low on brown sugar so I used a little less but I added maple syrup.

I doubled the topping and used evaporated milk since I only had 1%. WOW! Such a wonderful cake, I will make over and over again I am sure.",2006-05-07
98869,238699,5,1,"I forgot to rate this last time I reviewed but I just wanted to rate it as absolutley AMAZING!!!  Top notch!!  WOW !! SCRUMMYY!!

oh my goodness -what a cake - Try it is so easy and just YUMMY!!

98869,61660,5,1,Fabulous!  I really liked the glaze on top.  Loved the brown sugar taste!,2006-06-26
98869,245866,5,1,Simply wonderful! I just made this cake with some fresh pears my neighbor gave me and my mom could not believe how it could be so simple and so delicious! Thanks for sharing :),2006-07-28
98869,316453,5,1,"This has to be the most easy and moist cake ever!! The caramel sauce is divine, can't stop eating this. I halfed the recipe as didn't have enough of the ingredients, and topped up the brown sugar in the cake with maple syrup to make up the diff, as one reviewer did. it still took the whole 40mins, wasn't sure if it would as being halfed, but it turned out perfect. This will made again and again. just beautiful. Foodlover1",2006-08-22
98869,197463,5,1,What a wonderful cake!  I made it with fresh pears and in a 10 inch springform pan.  It was easy to make and very moist.Thank you Leslie! ,2006-09-10
98869,60504,5,1,This is the most moistest cake i have ever tasted! I wasnt a big fan of fruit cakes until i tried this one. THank you so much for sharing this recipe. I do think that it was a bit too sweet so next time i will use less sugar.,2006-09-12
98869,351573,5,1,"Great cake! I made for a dinner party, and everyone loved it. It is a very moist cake, and I would not change a thing about the recipe. Thank you for sharing it. ",2006-09-18
98869,119353,1,0,I made this cake yesterday.  We did not care for it at all.  I followed everything like the recipe said and it came out very dry.  Everyone else was saying how moist this cake is and mine was very dry.  I don't know what went wrong.,2006-10-05
98869,313783,5,1,"Excellent recipe! I made it with pears and it was very simple and straightforward. It came out nice and moist and spongy. The caramel topping was to die for, combined with a dollop of whipped cream. We'll be making this again for sure, next time with apples. A must try.",2006-10-06
98869,336123,5,1,"Absolutely delicious cake. I used 3 different kinds of apples from our tress. The topping is so good and makes the cake.
I am going to take it to work since I don't trust myself not to eat the whole thing this weekend.
Next time will mix apples and pears.
Thank you for a great recipe!!",2006-10-06
98869,264452,5,1,Great Cake! I think I like it better without the topping. ,2006-10-13
98869,199418,5,1,Yum - this recipe really lived up to its good reviews.  I made it with apples and it was excellent.  The only problem is that I can't stop eating it.,2006-10-14
98869,185926,5,1,"Delicious.  I did not have any vanilla so it was omitted.  I chopped up 4 medium to large apples, which came to over 5 cups, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup of each kind, added 3/4 cup of wheat bran and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping.  However, the cake came out delicious and moist.  It was more of a yummy bread than cake.  It was even better 12 hours later.  I cannot stop eating it.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.  This deserves more than 5 stars.",2006-10-22
98869,242578,5,1,"Absolutely GREAT! I couldn't believe there was no butter or oil in the cake...i actually read the ingredients twice before pouring the batter into the pan...
my nephews loved it! of course the rest of the family raved about it too...
thank you so much for posting--will certainly make it again...i might avoid the topping next time--goes perfectly with tea...
i guess i will be calling it healthier apple pie...",2006-11-12
98869,378004,5,1,"The cake was really great!  I made exactly to recipe.  I would like to taste more of the topping.  Next time I will make extra and pour on after the topping has cooled a little. 

Thanks for a great cake recipe!",2006-11-19
98869,665614,5,1,This cake was eaten in 1 1/2 days and I am making it again 4 days later.  I did add some nutmeg and poked holes in the top of the cake before I added the glaze.  Even better the next day.,2009-02-20
98869,394208,1,0,"I baked this (or tried to) in a 10"" springform pan. I had used 1/2 melrose apples and 1/2 bartlett pears, and was so looking forward to a yummy (Thanksgiving!!:-( ) dessert. It looked done, and a toothpick came out clean. However, upon slicing into the cake, it was pure goo in the center. I had followed the baking times suggested in the recipe. You might want to either alter baking times or not use a springform pan.",2006-11-25
98869,126146,3,0,This was more like bread than cake. I thought it was rather dry. Giving it 3 stars because two people told me they liked it. I threw most of it away. I baked it for 45 minutes as instructed. Smelled heavenly while baking.,2006-11-27
98869,317696,4,1,"I just had this cake for dessert.  It is great.  It had a very nice flavour and the topping was wonderful.  Unfortunately, the texture is a little rubbery.  I think either 45 minutes was a little too long in my oven or I overmixed the batter.  Next time I'll be sure to watch for both- and there will be a next time.",2006-11-29
98869,38745,5,1,This was a wonderful recipe.  I used pears.  I will make this often.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.,2006-12-04
98869,353579,5,1,Quite easy and a big hit at my house!  Made it with both apples and pears. Thanks for posting.,2007-01-01
98869,350602,5,1,This was very good!  I made it for my co-workers and they all wanted the recipe.  I then made it for my family and gave some to the neighbors.  I don't have to worry about any of this being leftover.  I used pears everythime I've made this.  Next time I'll try apples.  I'm sure that will be a hit too!,2007-01-13
98869,173579,5,1,So delicious!  Very moist and it had a lot of pears in it.  Also it was very simple to put together.  Will be making this often.  Thanks for posting.,2007-01-30
98869,93446,5,1,"A very nice, moist, delicious cake.  I made it with Bosc pears and used 3/4 cup egg whites instead of whole eggs and just half the quantity of sugar and it still turned out great.  The not-too-sweet glaze is the crowning glory.  I can predict that this cake will be finished by tomorrow night!",2007-02-02
98869,300920,5,1,"I love this. We only made 1/3 of it but it's still very filling and not TOO sweet, just right. I also added some orange zest which made it seem to taste more fruitier. Thanks for the recipe! :)",2007-02-10
98869,363759,5,1,"I made this for the first time a few months ago to bring into work.  It went fast.  Everyone LOVED it.  I even had one guy ofre to pay me to make another one for him and his son.  I used Fuji apples, I live in Japan and that seems to be the only baking apple I can find.  I also made extra topping. YUMMO!  I'm making it again tomorrow for a breakfast potluck.  Thanks for the great recipe.",2007-02-11
98869,404977,4,1,"I was super easy to make and tasted great. I would reduce the sugar next time as it was really sweet. Also, I made almost double for the topping adding most when said to, and the rest after slightly cooled. Worked well, thanks!",2007-03-19
98869,146812,5,1,"I just finished a piece of this cake and I have to say it's sooooo delicious! I used apple and can't wait to use pears. It wasn't too sweet, has a wonderful texture and really is incredibly moist. I added a few more spices due to personal preference and doubled the topping 'cause of my fiance's sweet tooth. I will definitely be making it again, thanks for the recipe!",2007-03-28
98869,344938,4,1,"Right out of the oven this was to-die-for, but just a good apple cake once it cooled.  It did stay moist, but nothing spectacular with the extra topping once cooled down.  Actually, you can't even tell the topping is on it when cooled and I think of the stick of butter and sugar on top and wish it wasn't there!  Very good cake, just would use another warm carmel toppping recipe that you can put on each piece individually to keep the warm carmally effect!  Thanks for sharing!",2007-05-18
98869,153188,4,1,I made it with apples.  It's a very delicious cake.  Thanks so much!,2007-06-12
98869,176615,5,1,"Yummy! Best served warm. Since there's no fat in the cake, the stick of butter in the topping's not so bad. I'd consider this a cross between a dessert and a cake, as such a little whipped cream is a nice touch. Thanks for sharing your recipe!",2007-07-29
98869,582533,5,1,"Wow i made this tonight with half apples and half pears from my backyard trees and it was a huge hit! thanks for the great recipe :)

98869,676097,5,1,"I made a cake for a breakfast with 8 people, in addition to an egg dish.  The cake is rather large (when using a springform pan).  I thought I would have about a quarter to a half of cake left for the week.  All that was left was one honorary slice.  Folks kept going back for more of it.  Super moist and yummy topping.",2007-12-20
98869,708727,5,1,"I made this with a Fuji apple and a Bartlett pear but left the topping off to save some calories. It was great! I'm sure the topping would make it even better but I can tell myself it's healthy without it. If you need a little more sweetness, drizzle caramel syrup over it and reheat it in the toaster oven. I also added half a cup of hemp seed and baked it at 325 F (hemp should not be heated over 325). That also made it ""healthy"". :) This also works as muffins or in shaped pans.

98869,229605,5,1,"this cake was ok last night after i cooked it, but sooo much better today! very easy, I used very over ripe pears and was super lazy and just put everything in the bowl at the same time, mixed it up, and dumped it in the pan. i poked holes in the top after it was cooked to let the topping soak in as others suggested. i didn't cook the topping much at all, lazy again and just boiled it and dumped it on. next time i'll double it and cook it for the time stated in recipe, it should be even better. i sent some w/ DH & friends hunting today and they all told me how good it was. don't think i'd change a thing, definitely a keeper! :)  UPDATE- i've made this several times now using both apples and pears and it's always a big hit.  always have people asking for a doggie bag!",2008-03-31

My changes : reduce sugar to one cup, reduce vanilla to one teaspoon, use half wholemeal spelt flower, stew the pears and mash.  If your fruit is supersweet you don't need so much sugar.",2008-09-24

I even did the toothpick test. I did get a taste from the outside edge and I'm going to try making this again. It has a very nice flavor and it's easy to put together. I don't know about the topping. I made it exactly as written and wondered if it was right. It didn't have much flavor and was very thin. I'm going to try to re-bake this and see what happens. It can't be any worse and we just can't eat raw cake batter. Yep, it's a big, gooey mess in the center. Thanks for posting this. I will make it again in a 9x13 and see what happens. Update: I threw this back in the oven and baked it for 20 minutes and it still wasn't done. I baked it 20 minutes more and it finally was done. Believe it or not, it is still moist and tastes fine. It's not very pretty but at least I didn't waste anything, especially my very expensive japanese pears. Update #2... I made this again in a 9x13 pan and it was done in exactly 45 minutes.

I made the full amount of topping and used about 3/4's of it.  I also sprinkled chopped walnuts and more diced pears on top prior to laying on the topping.

98869,1367616,5,1,"This is a wonderful recipe! i followed it precisely and folded ingredients in order. i was nervous about the heavy consistency of the mix until i added the pears, then it thinned out like a proper cake batter. i used all pears from our WA state friend's farm, just ripened, not too firm, not too yielding.

i used a springform pan & the cake rose perfectly and left a little ledge for the sauce to sit & cool with a tasty, drip border. it seemed to need longer to cook to get the center to stop wiggling (around 12-15 additional minutes), i have a nice metal cake tester & the recipe reminded me of banana bread so a little residue on the stick was acceptable and the cake didn't dry out, over-brown & harden or end up inconsistently soggy in places.

i reserved some extra sauce in the fridge for finishing and side topping for vanilla ice cream. i sprinkled a little powder sugar for decoration. This would even be great as cupcakes frosted with cream cheese like carrot cake or caramel-maple like German chocolate!

98869,285867,5,1,"Fantastic! I have a pear tree in my back yard and I never know what to make with all my pears. This recipe was excellent. The pears tasted just like apples. I thought I had all the ingredients, but I needed to make some substitutions when I found out I was missing a few things. I only had 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, so I substituted with 1/2 cup plain vanilla yogurt. I was also running out of brown sugar, so I only used 1/2 cup in the cake. I baked in a bundt pan because I like the way it looks when finished. I baked 50 - 55 minutes, then poked holes all over and poured in the topping and baked a few minutes more. My husband thought I made a carmel sauce and couldn't wait to eat it. The cake was great as a dessert and worked well for breakfast. I did not notice the cake getting wet the next day (as a reviewer posted) It was absolutely delicious, even with my substitutions. I will make this every year!",2009-09-05
98869,326540,5,1,This was a lovely cake!  I made it with juicy pears and it was delicious.  I made my own frosting rather than use the topping in the recipe because it was a special occasion birthday cake for my son's great grandma.  Thanks for posting this recipe!,2009-09-12

I made a few slight changes - used coconut oil for the oil, did 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp cinnamon instead of 2 tsps cinnamon and for the glaze, I didn't use as much butter. I think it would've been too soggy if I had. Not sure what 1 lb. butter translates to, but I only did something around the neighborhood of 1/4 cup. Will definitely be making this again",2010-04-14

I added another egg with no real change so I got back on to read reviews more to see if anyone else had the issue and seen they did. So I added the apples and kept mixing, spread it in the pan and baked. It came out good, has a nice taste but my ds said it needs icing. I used part Splenda in with the topping and you can't really tell it has a topping but it is really moist. I also poked holdes before pouring the topping on. As far as using 1 lb of butter it is 1/4 of a pound or 1 stick not a whole pound. Thanks for a nice recipe. I used 6 small apples.",2010-05-21

It was so thick that it was more a ""dough"" than a ""batter"".  Question to the person who posted this: Is something missing in the ingredients that would make this able to ""pour"" ?  Because try as I might...and following this recipe to a ""T"", it cannot pour.

98869,814986,3,0,"First off, a good portion of these many (113 as I write) reviews can't be for the recipe as written.  A number of the older ones talk about how great it is to find a recipe for cake with no fat... despite the cake having 1 cup of oil plus butter in its topping, as the recipe stands right now.  I don't see any ""Edited to add"" note on the recipe, so I'm not sure when the cake changed, either.  I decided it was worth trying since many of the most recent reviews still seemed positive.<br/><br/>The cake itself was fine.  I liked that it let me use 4 cups of apples, it was easy to prepare and the end product was moist.  Having made a couple of variations on this recipe as well, I will say that my family liked a less sweet cake (omitting up to 1 c sugar total), particularly if I used the topping, and that they also liked the texture when I left about 1/2 c of chopped apples out of the batter to press onto the top after smoothing it.  For a ""hearty breakfast"" style cake, we liked subbing 1/3 of the flour for whole wheat, and adding quick cook oats and chopped pecans to the top.  I also incorporated the recent suggestions to add more vanilla and cinnamon.  My batter was also very stiff; ""pour"" felt more like ""manhandle"" the batter into the pan!<br/><br/>Overall, okay for a starter recipe... at least as it was written the day I tried it. :)",2010-10-28
98869,262272,5,1,I made this with some sliced apples left over from a gathering.  I chopped my apples some what large and layed them on top of the batter. My DD and I ate over 1/2 of it the first day.  Unless I'm serving this to a group I'm going to have to make a 1/2 recipe.  If we didn't have nut allergies I would love to add some walnuts.

I make it in a 22cm tin and I have to line up above the top because it ends up about 6 cm high. It takes about 1 hour and 40 minutes to cook at 170-180 degress celsius.

The batter before the addition of the fruit was very stiff but it loosened a treat after adding ripe pears. It did take longer to bake than stated but I assume that was due to the liquid from the pears and a firmer fruit would allow the cake to bake quicker. The sweet, almost crunchy caramel layer makes it really special. I think the next time I make it with pears I&#039;ll use ginger instead of cinnamon...and there will definitely be a next time.

The butter/milk/sugar sauce over the top of the cake made the cake too sweet, the sauce gave the cake an overpowering flavour of butter, the sauce poured over the cake and cooked into the cake, wasn&#039;t balanced. The pears gave the cake a lovely fresh taste, but the cake was too sweet, with two cups of sugar in the mixture and 1/4 cup of sugar on top.  I will be looking for a healthier recipe next time that is also better balanced, as the cake was a bit crumbly which is probably due to the cup of oil in the batter.",2015-07-14

I also now use coconut oil in the batter for a more fragrant taste.  I have made it in a 9x13 and a large springform pan and it has always taken closer to an hour to set up properly before adding the topping.
Yes, it is true, there is no &quot;pouring&quot; this batter it is more like dough but don&#039;t add liquid to it thinking you did anything wrong...the topping and the fruit make up for it in the end!",2016-04-19

Well, the batter's pretty tasty anyway, so I'm bettin' the cooked version is good too. :) This recipe DID create a batter, not a dough as other reviewers said. Rather than mixing all the ingredients at one time, I mixed the sugars, reduced to 3/4 cup each instead of a full cup each, with the eggs, 1 TBS of vanilla, and 2/3 cup olive oil. (Seems to me, because the pears were SO ripe, more of the natural sugar came out--think of how sweet really ripe bananas are--and why even with reducing both sugars, it was still plenty sweet.) Then I added the dry ingredients. I noticed other reviewers added ginger, cloves, etc. I went straight to the Allspice, using bout 3/4 tsp. I think what gave me a *batter* is I had some really ripe pears...to the point some of them kinda mushed down giving me a batter, rather than a dough. I still had plenty of pear pieces tho.",2016-09-24

98869,2001860084,3,0,"The recipe does not print correctly. In the printed version the apples/pears are listed as an ingredient in the topping. Therefore the batter was more like a dough and turned out more like a cookie crust with caramel fruit topping. The flavor was OK, but it was not moist as the description indicated. When I referred back to the online recipe, it clearly says that the fruit should be in the cake. Perhaps that would add the additional moisture the batter needed to change the dough to batter.

I made a change to the recipe only because of poor planning on my part.  I didn't have a can of cream of mushroom (I KNOW, can you imagine???) so I went on a dig in my pantry and pulled out a can of creamed corn thinking it would help thicken the mixture like the soup would.  I used an entire 15 oz can and then let it cook on the stove a little longer as the mixture seemed thin, then while baking, let it bake about 15 minutes longer.  The corn added a nice texture and color to the dish.

I also had about 1.5 lbs of meat and rather than leave a half pound in the fridge, I threw it all in.

Because I had added extra meat, I had to put it in a larger dish.  I used the next size up Pyrex dish, which, of course, necessitated extra cheese.

Served with a lettuce salad on the side dressed with salsa rather than salad dressing and since I was out of sour cream, topped with french onion dip.

Myabe next time I'll actually plan better and have the right ingredients on hand.  :-)",2008-08-21

It&#039;s important to add that if you cook the ribs with this rub you need to mop them every fifteen minutes to keep them moist. This also helps to develop a good bark and smoke ring. 

I add the rub to the ribs at least an hour before and then mop and dust them before they go on the fire.  I finish with a op and dust and then let them rest at least 5 minutes, usually 10 to 15. 

For the mop I deviate from Rendevous. I use:

Dry BBQ Mop
1/2 C white wine vinegar
1/2 C apple cider vinegar 
1 C Water
1/3 Cup Dry Rub",2015-05-11

I gave it three stars because I liked it an will make it again with one modification...I made as written but felt like it was missing something and since there is no amount for the pineapple I used a large 20oz can. I found the pineapple to be over powering; but like I said, you didn't give an amount. You also didn't tell us what type of vinegar. There are many types...I used white and I think this is the way to go. I doubled the rest of the ingredients and added 2 Tbsp ketchup. I think the ketchup is what brought this around for me. I also used green bell pepper, red bell pepper, onion, and thin sliced carrot as this is what the Chinese restaurants use. I then tossed in fried popcorn chicken and served it with Jasmine rice. All in all very good and I'll make it again. I took off one star simply because this isn't a 5 star recipe by nature and another star for the fact that the recipe wasn't clear and it did need some touching up to bring it up to ""very good"" IMHO.

I flattened the rissoles out more so I could shallow fry them. These were served with lemon squeezed over and a bit of sweet chilli sauce.

(I nuked them in the reynolds microwave bag product-saved me some dishwashing.)  I dislike frying so oven baked these at 425 degrees F for 20 minutes and turned them halfway through.

In an effort to make an ""authentic"" dish, I added a little red food colouring to the marinade. When it didn't seem to do much colour wise, I added a little more, still nothing, so I added a little more. I ended up with a very vivid red sauce and recommend stopping after the first pinch.

158915,510313,4,1,Reviewed for ZWT III. I enjoyed this rice and so did my family - especially the kids. For my husband it was lacking a bit of heat so he mixed in some chilli paste. Very easy to make and no overpowering flavours which would be ideal if you have something very spicy to serve with it or if like me you are giving it to small children.,2007-06-25

158915,192849,5,1,"This is the recipe!  I've been trying to find the recipe that I grew up with in a Mexican family.  This duplicates it.  So good...very light, not overpowering, fresh.  The only change I made was to add some chopped onion to the rice during the browning portion and some salt just before simmering.  DH loved it as well.  I served it with sour cream chicken enchildas, refried beans and salad. Next time, I'm going to brown on the stove and put everything into my rice cooker as suggested by another reviewer.  Thanks for sharing!",2007-09-09
158915,248023,4,1,"We loved it... very similar to my way of preparing Mexican rice except for the tomato... I still have some cherry tomatoes on the vine, so I used a handful of those instead of a beefsteak tomato.  I pureed them along with 2 huge garlic cloves (can't get enough garlic!)  I used homemade chicken stock instead of water and added in half a cube of tomato bouillon for a little more richness.  When I saw the recipe didn't call for any salt, I knew I was going to have to add some in.  I'm very glad I did...otherwise it would have been very bland for us.  I also cooked my rice for 20 minutes and let it stand for another 5 min.  This made a lot of rice...way more than 2 servings so next time I will cut the recipe in half.  I loved the color of the rice and the garlic aroma was to die for!  Thanks for sharing!!!",2007-10-11
158915,498271,4,1,"Easy and tasty Mexican rice!  The toasting of the rice is important to the flavor so don't skip that step.  For me it needed salt and I added some at the end of the cooking.  I think pureeing some onion with the tomato would add some good flavor too.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT8, Chefs gone WILD!",2012-08-05
158915,705251,4,1,Great method of preparing mexican rice.  My kids and hubby really enjoyed it but I did tweak it a bit to give some oomph by adding 1/2 diced onion while sauteeing the rice and lots of ground pepper at the end and a dash of salt for seasoning.

It is so simple but yet so good. I would definately make this again. The only thing I'd change next time is I'd add maybe just 2 tbsp. of butter to the sauce rather than 4 because I had some sauce leftover and I couldn't use it all. I think we just preferred to use a little less for each serving. But that is a personal prefrence. And this is way too good to waste a drop! Thank's so much for sharing Tricia!!

I made these yesterday and despite following the recipe the nth degree, they came out awful. Wanting to know what it was I did wrong, I began looking at numerous other recipes and finally realized why. There appear to a number of details left out of the recipe. For one thing, the her directions of the making of the dough itself is confusing. She tells you to mix the yeast with warm water (no temperature) and sugar and allow the yeast to bloom. In the next instruction she tells you to add the flour, 1 cup at at time to the yeast mixture, oil and salt. Sorry back up there, for in her list of of much of how much of this and that, does even tell you you need salt in the first place. As such, I had to guess and my scant 1/2 tps of salt was, by far and way, not enough. Nor was I aware that you had to let the bagels dry before baking them. As a first time bagel maker, I had no idea this was necessary. And because I had taken several missteps in the making of these bagels, they took 20 minutes to bake, not 10. This recipe has the potential to be a very good one, but if you're a first time bagel maker, as I was, I'd not recommend the recipe for there are too many critical details left out.",2017-06-04

Both were very, very tasty.   To be honest, I'm not sure which I liked better.   I will probably make it both ways again.   ",2004-12-14
25038,42337,5,1,"I loved this pie, its just like my favorite aunts frittata except for the crust.  I used proscuitto, salami and pepperoni.  A very easy dish and great for a light dinner.  My hubby wanted to know where the rest of his dinner was, what can I say he has no taste.  ",2005-01-31
25038,168069,5,1,"Excellent!  I made this, then my brother brought a $30 Easter Pie that is always phenomenal.  There were two pieces out of the deli's pie, but mine (Richard's) is almost gone.  That says it all.  Use only the best ingredients, and you can't go wrong with this recipe.

I only made one mistake and that was that I didn't pay attention and bought regular, not deep dish pie crusts.  Just a little overflow, but it certainly didn't affect a thing.

This would be excellent for an informal party or a great thing to make on the weekend, then have for lunch or for family to snack on during the week.",2005-03-27
25038,29300,5,1,"Very nice rich pie. Brought it to work for a potluck and everyone loved it including myself. My boyfriend also was pretty fond of the one that I had kept at home for him ;-) Great recipe. Thank you so much, Richard :-)",2005-05-26
25038,37036,5,1,"Delizioso! This is a recipe that can really be adjusted for ones personal taste or based on what ingredients you have on hand.  I halved the recipe and used ham and pepperoni.  I also added about 1/8 cup finely chopped green bell peppers and 1 teaspoon dried basil to the mixture.  After it baked for about 50 minutes, I pulled it out of the oven and topped it with a little more mozzarella cheese, a little Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of oregano for color!  My DH and I really enjoyed it and I'll be making this one again!  Thanks Richard! ",2005-08-18
25038,12619,4,1,This dish was very easy to make. Which I like easy. The dish was costly to make. My hubby and son loved it. I thought it was a little runny. I baked  the pies for one hour like recipe said and let it sit. It still seemed a little runny. Maybe needed to cook longer? Not sure.,2005-12-25
25038,215083,5,1,"We just finished eating this and it is delicious.  What I wish I would have done is to place the pie pans on a cookie sheet.  One pie buckled on the way out of the oven so we were forced to serve that one with a spoon.   LOL

Thanks, Richard.  Very good and will get made again very soon for company.  This was its test run.  It passed with flying colors!  ",2006-07-16
25038,51109,5,1,"This was absolutely delicious.  I had to use more ham and pepperoni than called for, but I can't imagine that made a whole lot of difference.  I was a bit worried about the consistency of the mixture as it was much more solid than I thought it would be, but after baking the texture is perfect.  I'll be making this one often.  UPDATE---made this again for Christmas brunch, omitting the crust as one of my guests was low-carbing it.  Perfect!  In fact, I may make it this way again for myself.  All of my guests loved it!",2006-12-26
25038,110210,5,1,"Terrific for a brunch or dinner. Easy to make ahead and put in oven when it's time to make dinner. I cut the recipe in half as I only needed one pie, but I was considering making two and freezing one. Next time I will use proscuitto instead of salami. 
Thanks for the great recipe!",2007-07-15

25038,263542,4,1,"I would give the filling a 5 star rating- and the overall recipe a 3 star rating if I could.  I think this would make a great filling for ravoili or some sort of appitizer.  However, having it all at once in a pie was a bit much.  I definately won't make it as a pie again- but I will try and find some other use for the yummy filling.  I made 2- ate one and froze the other (uncooked).  I still haven't gotten the other one our of the freezer to see how it turns out.",2008-04-01

Thank you, Richard, for a new taste experience!",2008-08-20
25038,162826,5,1,"WOW! Tell your Mom ""well-done!"" I used cubed ham and salami, low-fat cottage cheese (sub for the ricotta) and some artichokes and a Roma tomato that I coarsely chopped. Added a whisper of Italian seasoning, too. Beautiful tasty of Italy! Made for the Northern Mediterranean event in Cooking Photos.",2008-10-05
25038,60989,5,1,"Yum! This is very tasty. I used low-fat cheeses and turkey pepperoni to cut the fat, and scaled this back to one pie. Next time I will add some sliced tomatoes to the top of the pie before baking, as I feel this would be a great addition. Thanks Richard!",2009-04-13
25038,1676574,5,1,These came out so beautiful.  I'm going to an Italian dinner party tonight and I was looking for something different to take.  I took the suggestion of adding spinach sauted w/garlic and olive oil to one pie just to make it different.  I also used spicy Capicolla instead of the ham.  I also put sliced tomatoes on top and sprinkled some parm. cheese on top the last 20 min. of baking.  I can't wait to try these tonight!  Richard thanks for sharing.,2010-09-05

88237,464130,4,1,these were good. very sweet actually but tasted good. didnt turn out as expected as the others said more like raisin pie. i suggest to cut down the sugar mixed with the sourcream to 1/2 cup or 3/4 cup as the raisins itself is already sweet. good recipe!,2007-05-14
88237,101823,4,1,"These weren't exactly what I was expecting, but they were still very good.  I had hoped that the cream filling would be more ""sour cream raisin pie-like"", but I think that the oatmeal kind of over rules that.  The flavor of this bar is more of an oatmeal raisin cookie with a creamy filling.  It is still good, just not quite what I had in mind.  I might have to whip up my favorite sour cream raisin pie just to get that fix.  LOL",2008-03-24
88237,186493,5,1,My husband LOVED these bars!!  It was my first time making these and they were a hit.  I did lessen the amount of sugar also.  Thanks for the recipe.,2008-07-01

190784,67656,5,1,"Yummy!  I actually played with this and quite easily turned it into a recipe for the WW Core program by using whole wheat penne, lean ground beef, and a combination of soy and fat free mozzarella.  Because it adds so much flavor and richness to tomato sauces, this one included, I used the red wine and simply counted points.  
The results were comforting, homey and delicious.  The flavors really exceeded the effort and time with the sauce having more flavor than one would think from such a short cooking time.  The amount of cheese added some nice gooiness without making the dish feel heavy.  Just a perfect lunch in the midst of a snow storm. Thanks Redsie!",2007-02-14

I cut it in half (just two of us) it worked great.I skipped the food processer (lazy, I didn't want to get it out or clean it) So I mixed all the tomato mixture together, using red wine and I doubled the red pepper flakes, we like hot and spicy. Turned out great! I will be making this again. Next time I think I will add in some green or red bell peppers. Thanks, Redsie for posting.",2007-03-30

276696,20480,5,1,This was really good! I did add some crushed garlic. I also made everything in the morning. After the meat was browned I place it in a casserole; then covered it with the mushroom sauce and finished off in my toaster oven for 45 minutes. It was super good. I served it with Rice Pilaf.I will make this again; always looking for good recipe for pork tenderloin.Thanks for posting. I made this for Phot Tag. Rita,2008-07-21
276696,482933,5,1,"Healthy for a meat recipe.  Mildly noticeable apple taste, not too sweet like some, very good! Moist chops-- love the sauce.  I used cider for the reduction and added a heaping quarter teaspoon of black pepper to this (DH and I love black pepper). I used fat free half and half.  Your timing directions were right on the button except I take longer than 5 minutes for the prep but am slow.  Served a grain pilaf with it.  Made for Theirs, Yours, & Mine game.  Thanks Boomie for another great recipe!",2009-10-16

70240,573325,4,1,"Wow, this is a very tasty way of making rice pudding!
It has a lovely brown top and a delicate rice and milk flavour. Mmmm! I could not locate quince paste anywhere near here, so I just threw in some raisins, which was nice, too. The fruity taste went really well with the creamed rice.
The preparation was easy and everything worked out beautifully. Mine was ready after 1 hour and ten minutes. In order to prevent it from browning too much, I covered it with baking paper after 50 minutes.
Its just that I found it to be quite eggy in taste, which is why Im not giving the full 5 stars. Perhaps thats cause Im used to stove top rice pudding without any eggs at all...
Nevertheless, this is great and also very impressive in its presentation. Definitely good for serving to guests.

Otherwise the pie came out great.   Made for photo tag, August 09.",2009-08-20
228948,443871,5,1,"Great recipe. I had to add an extra tablespoon of flour because my apple got very juicy when I cooked them. May have been from the long soak in the the lemon water to keep them from turning brown. I also added a little nutmeg, just because I can't imagine an apple pie without nutmeg. I also cheated and used a Pillsbury pre-made crust.",2010-09-10

I then went on to make a quadruple batch to hand out samples at our Homeschool group World Foods Party.

90026,151325,4,1,"Having picked lots of red currants and raspberries at a 'pick your own' farm (Garsons Farm, Esher, England) I was at a bit of a loss as to what to do with them: Jenny to the rescue!

I Didn't do it quite the same because a) I couldn't be bothered to sieve the red currants, b) I don't do boiling water baths and c) hving converted the measurements into pounds and ounces I realised just how little sugar Jenny uses; I doubled the amount to 6 cups and was able to reduce the boiling time (at step 8) by about half.  The end result is a beautiful colour and VERY YUMMY. 

Incidentally the cup measurements convert to 1lb 4oz red currants, 1lb 12 oz raspberries and 1lb 8 oz sugar (Jenny's recipe/3lbs my version).  

Glad I found this website.
Kind regards,
Caroline Blakey

I used real butter, skim milk, only 1 egg, sharp cheddar cheese and no bacon (didn't have any that was cooked...and didn't have time to deal with it).  This was a very quick and easy way to get the fluffy scrambled eggs that I love.  It was a major bonus not to have to take the time to stand at the stove and stir, stir, stir.

63860,65056,5,1,"Neat!  I wasn't sure exactly how this was going to turn out, but I have to admit, it worked great.  I used 2 eggs, and didn't bother with the bacon- just a nice amount of sharp cheddar cheese.  Mine took just about exactly 1 1/2 minutes on high in my microwave, but of course that can vary a lot depending on wattage.  It puffed up so much!  I was surprised.  When I finally took it out, I was so surprised to see the eggs near the rim of the cup!  Nice texture- I may have overcooked mine just a tad, but it was still great, especially considering I made it in the microwave!  This is so fast and easy (and less dishes to wash!) and it made a great snack.  I know it would make a great breakfast on the run, too.

I actually will cut bacon or sausage up and throw into a pyrex cup or a bowl, cover and microwave about a min or 2.  Then I remove the grease and the cup now is greased.  Then I add in scrambled eggs and mix, microwave at 1 min intervals, stirring between until the eggs are set how I like them.<br/><br/>amber",2011-01-19
63860,735705,5,1,"What a great, simple little recipe that can do so many different things quickly and easily.  I cooked two eggs and used one of my beloved Temptations ramekins instead of the mug, although I think a mug will do better.  Not even halfway through my cooking time a small portion of an egg exploded and I had a very small mess to clean in my microwave.  I think using the mug since it is deeper, as well as checking and stirring every 30 seconds would remedy this problem.  Regardless, I am thrilled with the simplicity and the flexibility of this recipe.  I recently tried omelets made in muffins pans in the oven and loved them. However, this recipe is even better as it is easier to just make one serving and you skip the waiting time for it to cook in the oven.  I used cooking spray intead of  the butter and it turned out just fine.  A couple of days ago I had made a full-size (aka time consuming) breakfast with bacon, eggs, grits, etc., and I had a couple of pieces of bacon left, which were perfect crumbled into this recipe.  I think I will start trying to set aside a few extra pieces each time I make bacon and crumble and freeze them to use in this recipe as needed. I also think a western breakfast in mug would be yummy with some onion and green pepper, along with sausage.  Mmmm, mmmm good.  So many ideas. This would be great for kids to make themselves too.",2012-09-18

I added bacon one day, sausage another, bread after that... changed the milk amount, added oregano and parsley. If you have a busy schedule(or have to wake up at 3am like me) and don't feel like taking the time to make breakfast but you still want an actual breakfast, do this! You won't be sorry! (Also useful to use a mug with a lid and save some for later!)

243340,133174,3,0,This is a well flavored barley pilaf.  Mine did not get creamy like risotto.  The directions did not say how much water to cook the barley in initially and I guessed.  We enjoyed this topped with some additional freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Good luck in *RSC 10*.,2007-08-24
243340,384041,3,0,"A wonderfully rich flavor even though I had to substitute canned mushrooms. It went perfectly with my grilled chicken and I can see it as an excellent companion to roast beef as well. However, the extremely involved preparation left a LOT of dirty dishes and the barley seemed unevenly cooked despite diligent stirring. In the future Iâ€™ll think of this when I see mushrooms on sale, but Iâ€™d simplify the preparation and increase the tomatoes and cheese. Note: There seems to be a typo in the directions â€“ an entire half-cup of chopped onions went missing. It seemed most likely that  step 3 should have said, â€œadd onions, reserving 1/4 cupâ€? â€“ the 1/4 cup that goes on in step 7 as garnish â€“ so thatâ€™s what I did. Note 2: Perhaps it was the health-food store barley, but all the barley-cooking steps took at least 25% more time than called.",2007-08-24

I guess I use this recipe as a guide and have made it with and without some of the ingredients and each time it is great. I like using the canned potatoes bc it tastes just as good without boiling your own and is way quicker. I do prefer to add the shredded cheese to the top of my bowl of soup instead of putting it in the pot . I use a larger can of evaporated milk I think it might be 10 oz? and a full 1lb of ground beef and 3 cans of the potatoes.

I have made the first batch and have left a half to prove in the fridge for until the weekend to see what difference there is in taste (spices infuse the dough over time). Ended up adding extra 200 g of flour at the end of kneading, also substituted molasses for black treacle, worked out wonderfully! Golden syrup would probably work just as well for more mellow and lighter in color dough. I used double amount of ginger, mixed peppercorns and cinnamon and some ground cardamom from whole pods. Mulled wine spice mix is perfect for this and you can also use clementine zest for the oomph :) Some of the gingerbreads are stripy because of me using silicone baster on them to glaze with egg. Cookies turn out crisp and you can vary the thickness to your liking. I went from very thin to very thick.

I love the ingredients but I feel this is a recipe which might be improved by using wine instead of stock, and a little less oyster and fish sauce. I could not find savoy cabbage, not even ordinary cabbage (it's almost winter here) and I used a large iceberg lettuce leaf, which worked just fine. Like Ellie I also had to use another kind of mushroom (don't think Cloud's Ears are available in SA!)  I so enjoyed the challenge if the dish, as I don't steam often!

The recipe called for 3 tablespoons of cinnamon; I used half that amount and it was still overbearing. I made them for my 2 daughters and a friend and each one took only one bite. Then I tried them and took only one bite also. That&#039;s all I could choke down. Way too much cinnamon! The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because they rose nicely.

83348,129833,5,1,This soup was very well received by my family. It was creamy even without the milk/cream. We had it as the main dish for dinner and it worked very well. It was very easy and fast to make which is always a plus in a busy schedule. I tried it once with the O'Brien style potatoes and once with the plain and the plain turned out much better. I added more ham than the recipe suggests because we like a lot of meat. Overall this was a great recipe that I'll definitely will make again.,2004-03-04

I have several friends that re lactose intolerant and they couldn't believe it was milk/dairy free.  I will be making this on a regular basis.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.",2008-04-02

I just think the recipe needs a little re editing to make it easier to read the first time. We used half red and green pepper to liven the colour up a bit too. But good flavour and a recipe I would love to eat again.",2003-10-09
58439,101275,4,1,Very nice. Made it for DH's packed lunch this morning. Cut and marinated the meat in the night itself. Did not add water or the cornflour as I wanted it dry. Finished off with oyster sauce as I did not have red wine vinegar. Omitted the water chestnuts too as did not find it in the market when I went shopping for ingredients.  Served it in buttered bread topped with some lettuce and cheddar cheese and then topped with dill mustard. DH loved it said very good blend of tastes and flavours.

Served with Recipe #513049, which can be made during the 10 minutes at pressure in a 2-liter/quart pressure cooker, as long as the rice has already been rinsed.  I think the recipe would benefit from some amounts for the flour, salt and pepper (1/4 cup, 1/2 tsp., and 1/4 tsp. respectively).  I cooked at 15 psi, which is the norm for pork and allowed the pressure to reduce naturally.  I then had to reheat the mixture after adding the vegetables to enjoy a hot meal.

Manda wondered about the nutritional value, so here are some facts: 1/2 cup of beans provides about 8 grams of fiber, 30-40% of our folic acid requirements, and they are high in protein. The bread actually provides the starch necessary to make this meal a complete protein. Just be sure to use low-sodium beans.

52286,2000799081,5,1,"Wowza. WHAT a sandwich.
I really was not expecting this to be THAT good.
Beans? Mayonnaise? Salt and pepper?
What magical alchemy would transform these humble ingredients into a five-star recipe? 
I was dubious, but after reading the glowing reviews, I HAD to try it for myself. My friend and I slapped some Duke&#039;s on Publix whole grain bread with some cannelini beans, and plenty of salt and pepper to taste, and after our first bite, were hooked.
We made sure to get the beans really dry after rinsing/draining-- we gently patted them dry with paper towels because we didn&#039;t want them to make the bread too soggy.
The key was ample amounts of salt and pepper. A second sandwich (adulterated slightly with some avocado), wasn&#039;t as good until the right ratio of salt and pepper to beans, mayo, and avocado was attained. 
This has definitely changed the sandwich game-- thank you Linda for sharing! Can&#039;t wait to try this in it&#039;s pure form, with baked beans instead of whatever I had in the pantry. 
Thinking next time it will be easier to eat if the beans are mashed up a little first-- they kept falling out of the sandwich. Other than that, five shining stars.",2016-01-04

My guess is some grated onions in this would be sublime. The chicken wrapped in the potato shell remained tender, not easy to do in the oven with cutlets but I thought the seasoning did  not fully lend itself to my palate.  Though I love Dijon, I felt some other additions might have elevated the condiment and made the dish stronger.  More lemon would have been great and perhaps an herb such as oregano or thyme.  That said the technique here is great and one that I would certainly use again.",2008-04-27

After reading the other reviews, I added thyme to the mustard mixture and sprinkled about 1/4 c. onions over the chicken before adding the potatoes.  I did find the Dijon to be a bit overpowering and didn't blend as well as I had hoped.  Possibly increasing the amount of onions would be helpful.

I followed the recipe to the letter, except I gave the chicken thighs a quick sear in a skillet first before going ahead with the recipe as written.  It smelled wonderful while it baked, but the flavor of the sauce never really got into the chicken, and the sauce had no body or viscosity to it at all, plus it tasted a bit watered down, as if the onions gave off too much liquid during cooking.  Perhaps the skin on the chicken kept the flavors out, but the result of all this left me feeling very disappointed.",2010-01-16
197788,97901,5,1,Super easy and very tasty. I used 3 large boneless skinless chicken breasts that I cut into chunks. I only used 1 onion and I cut it into chunks as well. I ended up being 1/4 cup short on the grainy mustard so I added Dijon. It didn't seem to adversely affect the flavor at all. I only had to bake it for about 30 minutes. It made a lot of sauce but that could be my only using 3 chicken breasts.,2011-05-02

A little different to the caramel slice I have made before. I used gluten-free flour in the base to make this a gluten-free slice. I also used a little more chocolate for the topping....though my tin size may have been slightly larger. I used the standard Aussie ""slice tine"" to make this recipe.

I substituted with ground pecans. I also did not have golden syrup, so I subed with karo syrup. So far I had to give the recipe to 4 people who said they melted in their mouth. I also found that when baked with the caramel it took only 7 minutes. This could be due to the fact that while making the caramel I cooked it longer. One very important fact is that one should stir the carmel constantly. End result is DELICIOUS & AWESOME

195440,296809,4,1,"I knew making this recipe would be an experiment when I tagged it. The main prob I face w/recipes is an ingredient issue as many US ingredients are unavailable here or found only at pricey import stores. Farina was the culprit here, but the dictionary mentioned grits as a poss sub for it & I wanted to see if they would work. Using 3 tbsp of instant grits, I cooked the mixture till near gravy thickness. My yield was 2 half-cup ramekin servings as expected from a half recipe, but I can testify grits work nicely in this recipe. I followed the hint in prior reviews to add the cocoa powder as a final step, but had to use my magic bullet to incorporate the lumps that resulted. Chill time was key to get a pudding texture & the texture was a tiny bit grainy, but not at all unwelcome as I feared it might be. This was easy, fun to fix & had a lovely choc flavor w/o being overly sweet. Thx for sharing this unique recipe w/us. :-)",2008-05-22

I don't like pudding skin, I should have put wax paper on it when it cooled so that the skin wouldn't have formed.

When the milk is hot, I stir it into the mixing bowl & add maple syrup (I've used Splenda instead of sugar as well, it works great).

325674,24386,1,0,"I hate to give one star reviews, but this recipe that I had high hopes for was so very disappointing.  Followed the recipe exactly, leaving out the chocolate chips and microwaved it for the three minutes required.  The cake rose above the cup and then sunk to about half a cup when removed from oven.  I did not plan on eating it immediately, but when I did, it was very rubbery and I must say not too tasty either.  I threw it out after one bite.  I would be interested if others have the same results.  Sorry.",2008-10-24
325674,601528,3,0,The ease of preperation makes this a fun little cake to make but I just didn't like the end result very much.  I found the cake to be too dense and not really very cake like and the taste to be slightly rubbery as many foods can be when heated/cooked in the microwave.  It is a good fast  chocolate fix though!,2008-10-25
325674,428885,5,1,"Truly speriffic! This was great, and I did not change a thing. I added mini chocolate chips, walnuts, and raspberry flavoring instead of the vanilla. The time is exact on this, I used a tall football mug to accommodate it. It grew very tall in the microwave! *UPDATE* (11/8 - I found if you use a 14 ounce coffee mug, this seems to accommodate this perfectly). I highly recommend this, as there is no doubt this recipe works beyond and then some. Thank you Noni!",2008-11-08
325674,96641,4,1,"Saw this and just had to make it.
Was big enough for both DH & I.
I think butter would make it less dry.  This is an extra rich cake.
I searched the pantry for real chocolate chips and only had some of those funky grain chocolate chips from the health food store.
Next time I will use some high quality chocolate and 1/2  butter and top with pecans 
( cuz I like 'em)
If it turns out better, I will come and revise.
I would say more brownie like.
Maybe a little espresso powder and some Kahlua could also be good too.
Thanks Noni!

325674,383853,4,1,"What a great idea!  I will agree that it was a little more than just 1 serving...I probably should have shared it! lol.  I added pecans instead of walnuts for personal preference.  I really enjoyed this, and it definitely fulfills the chocolate requirement when I'm in a hurry and don't want a whole cake.  I ate it right out of the mug and topped it with some ice cream and caramel syrup.  yum. Thanks so much for posting...I'm sure I'll be making this alot. :)",2008-11-10
325674,74281,5,1,"Holy COW this is good... and easy too. It was just a little bit dry but that could have been how I measured. Next time I think I will try sprinkling hocolate chips on top of the cake instead of on the inside. This is DEFINITELY not just one serving (more like 2 or 3) as it is really rich and very delicious! Topped mine with whipped cream and it was just the right touch.  UPDATE: It had to be my measurements that made the cake dry, because I made it again tonite and it was moist and delicious. I did only one thing different this this... I made the cake batter in a bowl and put the chocolate chips in the bottom of the cup then poured the batter over it. After it cooked for 3 minutes I dumped it onto a plate, and it so good with the melted chocolate chips dripping down over the cake. This is a really versatile recipe that I will make often!",2008-11-20
268671,168462,5,1,I have made this twice already and both times loved it. I just used red pepper as that was what I had on hand. As the recipe did not specify I used dill pickles and added 2 chopped green onions. I also love cilantro so I subbed that in place of the parsley. We loved this salad. It was easy and tastes great. If you are looking for an unusual salad that is full of flavour give this one a try. Thanks for the recipe.,2007-12-03
268671,324390,5,1,This makes a great light salad. I also used all red peppers as it is what I had on hand. I served this on a bed of spinach leaves dressed in Russian Dressing. The result was a salad that was out of this world! Thank you so much Katia.,2008-03-09
268671,67656,5,1,"The weather is warming and my appetite for salads has returned from winter hibernation.  The unusual combination intrigued me but I love tuna and it's versatility.  I made two substitutions in my preparation; first reducing the oil to a meager 2 teaspoons for my low-fat diet and the other to replace the pickle with 1/2 of a small red onion finely diced, as I am not fond of the former with tuna.  The salad was just wonderful with sweetness,  crunchiness and tang filling each forkful.  Moreover this dish is gorgeous and visually appealing with the vibrant colors of the corn and peppers against the verdant parsley. Thank you so much for sharing katia.

325674,1151614,4,1,"The testure came out weirdly spongy, but that could be because of the substitutions I made.  I substituted an exact amount of Splends for the sugar, and in place of the egg and oil, I added in an entire individual serving container of applesauce.  The taste was fantastic, but the cake didn't rise at all.  I'll be tweaking this some more, but the original nutritional stats were just too scary to make it by the recipe.",2009-01-30
325674,535033,5,1,"Amazing!  Yummy!  Fast!  I added a tiny dash of salt, and it really made a difference.  I also forgot the vanilla, and it was still yummy.  And, I put the chocolate chips on top of the cake as it's cooling.  Makes a yummy, quick frosting.  I think we've had this 4 times in the last week.  A big, ceramic soup bowl can also work in place of a mug.",2009-01-31
325674,1145917,4,1,"Okay, this is pretty deadly. It's not really a pretty dessert, but I think that belies its manufacture. Cope. 
I did have cake flour.... but did not have milk, so I used water and threw in some nondairy creamer. I did not have chocolate chips, but added a teaspoon of instant coffee. I used Ghiardelli unsweetened cocoa. I probably should have sprayed my mug, still, it came out in one piece after I ran knife around edge, and should clean easily. Apparently my mug was big enough, because nothing escaped. I was unsure of the wattage of my 1989 quasar oven, so cooked it an extra 30 sec.

The texture is spongy, but in a poundcake kind of way. It's quite dense. After cooling, it sliced into 4 x 3.5"" rounds about 3/4 inch thick. If I wanted to hurt people, I'd spread them with nutella or something, and serve it with ice cream, still warm. I think I'll skip the coffee next time. I think you could make it with less oil.",2009-02-02
325674,628696,4,1,This came out a little spongy and rubbery in texture but dense and very chocolaty. I wasn't expecting perfection from something so easily assembled and nuked in the microwave but this was way better than what I did imagined. I swapped out one of the tbsps of milk for hazelnut coffee creamer. Next time I may sub all of the hazlenut creamer for a richer taste.,2009-02-09
325674,164610,5,1,"OMG!  So glad I found this recipe; actually I found more than one, but decided to try this one.  I was craving chocolate cake but did not want to bake a whole one or even a bunch of chocolate cupcakes.  I had never heard of this mug cake thing before.  For dietary reasons, I used 1/4 cup Eggbeaters for the egg and unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and Silk Unsweetened Soy Milk for the regular milk, following the rest of the recipe as directed.  I had to use a cereal bowl instead of a mug as I don't have large mugs.  Cereal bowl worked out great!  Cake smelled wonderful, only needed 3 mins cook time as directed,  It rose slightly but did not need to worry about overflow, though I had wax paper down.  I let cool for 5 mins.  I ate after 10 mins so cake was still warm.  This is very dense, spongy, but still delicious!  Normally I like a lighter textured cake, but this had just the right feeling of cake plus pudding or cake plus sauce or something that I enjoyed it a lot.  Surprisingly the bottom was moist like a sauce sort of.  Maybe the few choc chips I used sunk?  I was worried the shape of a cereal bowl would cause uneven cooking, but I didn't have a problem (it was a stoneware bowl from Corelle).  This mug cake is best eaten warm imo b/c I think it will toughen up if you let it cool off.  I did add about a tbsp of dairy-free semisweet choc chips.  I didn't have walnuts.  This ended up being a nice chocolate fix for me.  Thanks so much for sharing.  I will be making again for sure.  Oh, I have to add this cake is almost better for sharing with 2 people.  I feel stuffed and this cake wouldn't really save well for later.",2009-02-15

The problem was that by the time it had cooled enough to frost and eat - it had become ROCK hard and could not be eaten.  I'm thinking I need to reduce the cooking time by about 30 seconds and see how that does.  I will give this a try as I think this would be a great gift idea in a pretty mug as suggested by others.

However. This cake exploded out of my mug in 45 seconds in the form of hot chocolatey, yet disgusting smelling lava. Poured that into a larger mug and cooked at 30 second intervals; still smelled horrible. Did not eat it, one lick of the spoon told me it was inedible. Will certainly not be using this recipe ever again. I created an account just to say this.

I don&#039;t think there was enough meat for 4-6 people and I did put extra in. It was cooking for a long time on low heat as suggested and the sauce had hardly reduced, so you will see from my picture that mine was still very runny.

Didn't have small onions, so took one large one and cut it into eighths, couldn't find my cheesecloth (or I don't have any - I'm still looking!), so just put the herbs in with the broth and wine and just discarded the bay leaf, and only had lowfat bacon, which made for scant drippings, but it all still worked out beautifully.  The taste was delicious, the chicken was moist, and soaked up the juice/broth/wine, which is good, since we also didn't have any bread, either!  We'll have the leftovers for dinner tonight (gonna get some bread this time), and I can hardly wait.  You guys have GOT to try this - it is PERFECT for company, since you can get it cooking before guests arrive, clean up your kitchen (minimal mess, too, I might add), and just wait for the magic to happen.

I couldn&#039;t find pearl onions so I substituted Mexican bulb onions and added the stalks cut in bite sized pieces and saute&#039;d with the garlic.  As another recipe had suggested, I added about 1/4 cup butter to the bacon fat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I used about 8 large fresh mushrooms - trust me, you want more mushrooms, they are DELICIOUS!  And of course 8 cloves garlic.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I saute&#039;d everything in a large cast iron pan as the recipe calls for and then transferred everything to a large lasagna pan, adding the wine and broth (made with Better than Bullion organic).

414765,416191,1,0,"I had some frozen berries that we picked last summer, that I wanted to use up so I looked for a no-bake pie and decided to try this one. I had no cooked pudding but had instant pudding to use up so I made it exactly as directed on the package with 2 cups of milk. Then I added the jello and it mixed nicely, no grainy taste at all.
       However, it tasted awful. The flavor of vanilla pudding with jello powder is not good.I had to do something as it was all made, so I put it in a graham shell and into the fridge it went. It did not set, so I put it in the freezer and it is staying there until I decide what to do with it. It will be ""sliceable"" frozen and maybe with some cool whip it may be edible.
    The use of instant pudding  instead of cooked would make no difference in the end result.

I followed the directions exactly using the cook and serve pudding. This was a hit at my 4th of July BBQ.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!,2011-07-21

When that was done I shredded the pork for other uses (along with all the great dried fruit & seasonings)! Am already seeing myself serving some of the shredded meat (with some additional dried fruit sauce) over brown rice & veggies!

Was I wrong, by the time it was reduced with the spices, it was exactly right. And the aroma while reducing, filled the house with heaven!! And the taste,I wish I had better words to describe it, the sweet warm spiceyness of the dates,almonds and sauce with the coolness of the mascarpone and the touch of salt was perfection!! I really have to restrain myself, I shouldn't even have had one, but I had to, the aroma just captured me and the devil made me do it!!  One less for DH and the rest.

62519,165533,0,0,"I made it and i will make it again before rating it but this is what i think. First of all it's way too much wine. Even reduced by half it's way too much wine. I ended up using less than half of the reduced wine. Second - the listed amount of spices is too much. It gave the wine a bitter taste and an odd flavor that really didn't give any hint about cloves or pepper or anything but something not-quite-right.
Maybe having to boil so much wine until is reduced by half took out all the flavors from the spices and I was left with their bitter taste. I'll try again using half the wine, 1/4 of spices or less and a pinch of salt to balance bitterness.",2006-05-05

I too ommitted the water - 
These fish cakes were ""spot on"" and hubby gave 5 thumbs up.
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  A keeper for sure!!

Once again thanks!",2007-02-25
40621,613609,5,1,I had some left over mashed potato and left over cooked whiting fillets. I used this basic idea and then to stretch the quantity added some grated carrot and colby cheese as well as some garlic for flavour! I added shallots instead of onion as the fish was already cooked and I wanted it make sure the onion would be cooked quickly. I made the patties smaller by dropping a good spoonful of mixture into my hot cast iron fry pan and turning once when very browned.  They were absolutely delicious with a fresh salad for lunch!! Would definately do again!!,2008-05-25

I think most people could eat 2 of the patties so I'd say that 2 potatoes makes 4 servings. I used a pound of fish and about 1/4 cup of onions and the 2 eggs. I didn't add the water. Instead of salt and pepper I added about 2 teaspoons of Old Bay Seasoning. I sauteed the onions in a little oil before adding them to the fish/potato mixture. Next time I'll probably add a little cayenne because bf likes his food to have a ""kick"". I made the patties the night before and then fried them up right before dinner. I dredged them in a little seasoned flour before frying them.

He likes a smoked flavor to his fish cakes so to the Finish Tilapia I had on hand, I added smoked Paprika, if I had used Salmon, I would have used a little liquid smoke. My husband liked these, but he did say, he wants me to try less potato next time but I loved them just the way they were. He also likes his fish cakes, dusted with bread crumbs or Panko. So again, that is what I did.
I browned them in olive oil.

I read other reviews and noticed that many people had trouble keeping the patties together.  2 ways around that:  1.  add some breadcrumbs to the mix.  2.  Put the cakes in the fridge for 20 min. before frying.

Different fish will taking different times. My snapper would of been nothing left, so you may want to mention what type of fish to add.<br/>- Third, I added Old Bay, fresh parsley, lemon zest, and scallions. It seriously needed seasoning<br/>- Fourth, I did add 1 tablespoon bread crumbs to help keep them together as I had that problem too, and did not use the extra spoon of water.<br/>- I coated very lightly in bread crumbs, froze for just 15 minutes or so to FIRM up and then cooked.<br/><br/>I served it with a lemon dill sauce.<br/>So overall, easy, yes. But definitely not what I consider a fish cake, too much potato vs fish. But it was still tasty and if you are like me and like lots of flavor ... I highly recommend adding additional seasoning.<br/><br/>But they were good and a nice easy method.

I tried using several different kinds of oils, including canola and grapeseed, but nothing assisted in holding the patties together.

81698,90672,5,1,this is sinful and perfect for the holidays. I used a restaraunt grade margarine for we have a dairy allergy in our house. It turned out sinful. I also used some bakery donut cherry filling drizzled ontop and it was wonderful. You could probably use a fruit preserve or thick sauce.,2005-10-19
81698,130819,5,1,"I have always been intrigued with Danish pastries, but never made them. I am very impressed with this recipe. This pastry is incredibly good. It may be sinfully rich but it's worth the splurge! Can't wait to be taking this to the next pot luck!",2006-01-09

I e-mailed kiwidutch and she was so helpful in asking for information and also providing information on the difference between extract and essence. Essence is stronger and to use 1/2 of what the essence called for.  I used 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I do like vanilla. Over the glaze, I put chopped walnuts. This recipe is easy to follow and easy to make. It also looks delicious.

I followed the recipe to the T but here are the problems I encountered:  the second layer didn't come to a smooth ball as described in step 4; rather, it was liquidy.  It was so liquidy that I poured the mixture instead of spreading it as described.  After I baked it,  it puffed up to like dutch babies.  Then when cool,  I spread on the icing only to find the icing to seperate after 6 hours into liquid and caused the danish to get soggy.",2007-03-18

338668,452940,3,0,We were really hoping to like this as we love roadhouse steaks. We went and got 4 beautiful ribeyes and I measured and mixed the marinade as directed. The only thing I did different was to pan sear them rather than grill them as it was raining outside.

338668,482376,5,1,"Fantastic steak recipe. I made as directed but used New York strip steaks. The rub is nice and peppery, which we love.

338668,133174,5,1,I reduced the recipe to serve 2 and used sirloin.  The rub has plenty of heat and the meat was well seasoned.  The steaks were grilled on the outdoor grill.

304703,160974,5,1,"Thank you Olha! I recently had a piece of this cake at a local restaurant and immed. went to ""Zaar"" to find the recipe. Yours looked like it had all the components, raisins, finely chopped nuts, in a 3 layer cake. I appreciated how EASYthis was, mixing up all together in one bowl! I used a few tsps. of sherry in the frosting, since that is how the restaurant had it (it really just highlights the orange flavor) and used currants for the raisins (it makes for more delicate bits of fruit) I served  this for my mother- in-law's birthday and it was a hit with all the guests! The cake cut wonderfully, too. It looks very ""classic"" and homespun, with the 3 layers. This cake tasted exactly like the one I had at the restaurant, too! Thanks for posting!

304703,468351,5,1,"This is the same recipe I have had for years. It is a really good orange cake. It makes a pretty layered cake but sometimes I bake it up in a sheet pan and change the icing for a different look. Plus, I usually always use finely chopped walnuts instead of pecans. I generally make a white buttercream icing and save a bit of the icing for tinting orange.Then I swirl the tinted icing on top of the cake that has been frosted with white icing, giving it a Dreamsicle/Creamsicle look just for a little something different.",2011-03-18

7303,4105,4,1,I would rate this one a five-star if the hot pepper flakes were omitted. I would omit the hot pepper flakes and use 3 cans of tomatoes and add 1 can of tomato and green chile's. Also for the next time I prepare the recipe I will devein and shell the shrimp then sprinkle cajun spice mix and let the shrimp marinate in it. If anyone attempts this recipe and uses 1/4 cup of the hot pepper flakes you will probably not be able to eat it if you cannot handle hot and spicy food. Believe me I am an amateur Cajun Chef and I could eat the dish but most people could not handle it. I will make this dish because it is rather quick and it is a one dish meal. I will however change it as stated in the beginning of this comment/rating.,2001-01-29

I'd have to agree but also point out that the recipe called for 1/4 teaspoon, rather than 1/4 cup. This might explain why he thought it was a tad toasty. I made it with the pinch of pepper and loved it. Thanks",2001-02-22

I used Italian eggplant, and 3 cans of diced tomatoes with 1 can of tomato sauce, 2 Tablespoons of garlic.  I also modified the recipe to reduce the fat content.  Instead of using 2 tablespoons of oil to saute the eggplant, I sprayed a nonstick frying pan with Olive Oil PAM spray and was therefore able to tastefully reduce the fat content by more than 50% (sauteed the garlic in only 1 teaspoon of oil instead of 1 Tablespoon in nonstick frying pan as well).

I am not sure how many cups of chicken I used. 4 breasts from a BJ's bag of frozen chicken ; is what I used.  I doubled the marinade and salad recipie and left out tarragon, only because I didn't have any.  I served this on toasted croissant rolls and it was great.  I do think that I will add an extra recipie of marinade next time if I choose 2 serve it on rolls.  I had some without a roll and thought it was more flavorful.   I only marinated mine for 4 hours or so though so that may have been some of it.  It was still the best chicken salad I've ever had and probably the only only I'll ever make again.",2009-05-11

I am very sorry - the flavor combination of the 3 spices didn't work for me in this,and I also found it to be very dry.

I always have onions. Not tonight, and I was partway through the recipe when I found out, so we had it without onion. It is delicious. I don't know if the onion would improve the dish or not. I may just leave the onion out from now on. ",2004-11-04

Did not use zest as a garnish, since one guest is allergic, and I juiced all the tangerines I had, so no segments. No nuts either, since the menu included another dish in which pecans were prominent. The garnishes were not missed, the sauce was wonderful on its own.

I let that cook for a few mins until the rice had expanded. At that point I replaced the chops and toped it all with the full can soup (DH *loves* it!. Put on a snug fitting lid and turned the heat to ""minimum"" and let it sit for about 20 mins. The rice and ""gravy"" tasted great and the chops were moist and tender.

I was happy that Mecoombs had mentioned using regular chips with good success, because that's all I had.   Like KateL, I used the Nordic Ware 30th anniversary pan.  The only two changes I made was to use 2 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda.  If  you are curious about this, please read my page for an explanation.

It has some pumpkin taste but it's not as pronounced as it is in pie.  <br/><br/>I increased the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons, but I have a high tolerance for cinnamon ;)  Also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.  Like one of the other reviewers I cut the oil in half and made up the difference with buttermilk.  I also subbed one cup of the AP flour with whole wheat pastry flour.  I used one whole egg and 2 egg whites and used flax seed meal mixed with water to make up for the missing egg yolks.  I cut the sugar by one cup (used a cup and a half) and it suits my taste very well (if I make this for other people I will use the recommended amount).  Finally, I used only 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  I'm thinking that pecans will go into it next time.  One hour of baking and it was done perfectly.<br/><br/>This cake took my substitutions very well.  I will make it again.  The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it is somewhat heavy, which is probably due to the pumpkin.

There was the perfect amount of gravy for the meat and potatoes, but if you are only using the sauce for the chops, I think it would be enough for 8.

231222,377070,5,1,"This is my 2nd time making this recipe - it's very tasty.  I have a similiar recipe but wanted to try adding a bit of my own to this one and see what happened.  It was good!  Still mainly her base recipe (because her's is easier to do and a better recipe) but with a wee bit of my own along with it. 
So - I browned the chops first which is not in the directions but is in the initial description as a suggestion. In my mind, this is a very important step for flavour and texture. I sprinkled some garlic salt and seasoning salt on them before browning. 
Into her mixture for the sauce, I added one very finely chopped up jalapeno pepper. This doesn't make it hot at all but is a nice addition to the other flavours in the mix. 
After the chops were browned and put in the baking dish, I kept the frying pan hot and poured in 1/2 cup dry white wine (Sonoma Ridge Pinot Grigio to be exact but a chardonnay would work nicely too - especially an unwooded one). That loosened up the bits in the pan nicely and added lovely flavour poured into the waiting sauce. **you can't taste the wine in the sauce but it does enhance the other flavours quite nicely. 
I basically followed the recipe otherwise with one other small change - I didn't have parmesan cheese so used romano. Was good. 
The sauce was so flavourful. Used it on top of boiled potatoes too. This is a ""lick the platter clean"" kind of meal.

Try Stevia instead, and use a lot less.  also, use real natural peanut butter, like Smuckers that is made with no sugar.  And use about half the brown sugar, same reason .. too sweet!

There were so many that it just crowded the pan, and, while the chicken and onions cooked, they really didn't brown.  After adding the remaining marinade and water, there was an awful lot of liquid.  Since it didn't dissipate enough, I chose to thicken it with some cornstarch mixed with water.  This provided a nice sauce.  The taste is rather tart at first, with a spicy kick right behind it.

I did buy penne pasta especially for this recipe but DH who works from home polished it off for his lunches during the week so I came home from work and was forced to substitute the tagliatelle that we had in the cupboard instead... it doesn't effect the result I think, which is a nice blend of flavours.

I didn't have green chilis so I used one fresh red jalapeno pepper and just a little over 1tsp of chili powder and it was just right, nice and spicy without being too hot.

426278,653438,5,1,Made this for the Fall Pick a Chef 2012 tag game and what an easy and tasty dish.  DH really enjoyed this.  I cut the recipe down for the two of us and used  skinless tilapia fillets.  I did dust both sides with the seasoned flour and fried both sides in the oil instead of one side and covering them (DH likes both sides fried).  Definately a keeper.

I substituted Dijon mustard for whole grain mustard and I didn't have chives at home so I used a tablespoon of onions.  The mascarpone really gave this recipe a wonderful flavour and I really like the fact it was so quick to put together.  Thank you Lene,2008-01-29

240803,122878,5,1,"Wonderful waffles!  I followed the recipe exactly as written using 2% milk instead of powdered milk and water and used the Bisquick brand baking mix.  Yesterday, I made the waffle recipe from the Bisquick box; I felt they were too heavy; I decided to try this recipe and and am so glad I did. These waffles turned out so light and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and were a nice golden brown.  It took just a minute to beat the egg whites and fold into the batter, but oh boy, does it make all the defference in the final product.   My grandchildren agreed, these need to receive much more attention than they've gotten - 5 thumbs up all around this breakfast table.  I can see where it would be very easy to add other ingredients to this batter, which I will be trying soon.  Additioins such as cinnamon, blueberries, chocolate chips, grated apple - the list could be endless.  Thanks Carla's Kitchen for sharing this wonderful gem of a waffle recipe with all of us.

My changes were to the boiled, drained noodles I added a whole 8-ounce bag of shredded sharp cheddar, a half of a bag of another and a half of a bag of shredded mozz; which was what I had in the fridge and I totally forgot the jalapeno.  I didn't top it off with cheese; all my ingredients were mixed in, then poured into a grease-sprayed 9x13 pyrex dish.

I used, papaya, mango, blackberries, pineapple and strawberries.  Went beautifully after our Caribbean Jerk Chicken With Fresh Fruit Salsa.  What a great dinner, my DD was practically in heaven LOL

My mom served them at a class meeting and they all liked them... then she took them to the gals at the bowling alley and they loved them, too. So.. this recipe is for sure a keeper. Thank you. I found that I didn't have to put them so far apart on the cookie sheet as they didn't spread out very much. I'll certainly add these to my holiday cookie list.",2002-03-22
94116,29196,4,1,"I made this for our dinner last night. I wanted something quick and easy, and it was. We loved the marinated chicken, but were not so fond of the sauce. It was a little bitter for some reason, and I had to add some brown sugar to it too reduce the tartness. That was good, because the chicken was already quite tart from the marinade. I would make this again as a summer BBQ dish, but not make the sauce.",2004-09-06
94116,101275,5,1,I think this dish was very nice. The sauce was very good and DH and me loved the meld of flavours and the tartness. A combo of Indian and Thai and then baked too is my type of cuisine so bring it on FM. You will find a very eager taker in me. I did add a little cilantro chopped for garnish and a little jaggery to the sauce. Served over rice and a salad and we were sorted out. Thank you! :D Fay ,2004-09-21

95440,22015,5,1,Very good!  We recently joined the SCA (www.sca.org for more info) and I had heard about fighter biscuits.

95440,91392,5,1,"I just made these with a copycat Bisquick recipe--no problem and less expensive than buying the real thing.  Because of where I live, I also had to mix my own sausage, and I used Italian sausage spices.  I got 30 good -sized balls.  You wouldn't want more than one or two per person as part of an appetizer table.  They cooked in 30 minutes on parchement paper, which really helped with cleanup. I also had to to use Swiss as there is no Cheddar here, but I don't think that made any difference.  Really fast and easy, especially if you do it all with your hands.  They didn't spread much while cooking, stayed blob-like, so I would put more on a tray next time to make it even faster.  I know this will be a cheap, fast and tasty cocktail party recipe, which is exactly what I was testing it for.  This batch will go towards breakfasts, snacks and instead of sandwiches for lunch.  A good find here that I got completely at random.",2005-06-17

319960,857580,4,1,"This was good, but it needed a little tweaking. I tasted the marinade prior to putting the beef in and the olive oil taste (or lack of taste) was overwhelming. I added balsamic vinegar, worcestershire and dijon mustard (and I used a tablespoon of fresh thyme instead of dried). I cooked it in the oven on 500 until I got a nice sear and finished it in the crock pot with a little leftover marinade. The marinade and juices make an awesome gravy. I will definitely make this again, but I think I will use beef stock/broth instead of olive oil.",2009-02-16
319960,461834,5,1,"Well doesn't sound like the first reviewer actually made this recipe and she really missed out, as this was so very flavorful.  I made this for dinner for just DS and myself, so I used a small eye of round (approx. 1 1/2 lbs) and made 1/2 of the marinade.  Oh my did my house smell great while this was searing and roasting in the oven.  This didn't specify sweet or dry Marsala wine to use, so I assumed the dry and used Lombardo Dry Marsala Wine.  The only thing I did differently was to season it with a blend of salt, pepper and garlic powder after searing it.  This is a great change from plain roast beef.

319960,1537310,5,1,"I used this as a ""basic"" recipe and used what I had on hand. I wasn't sure about the lemon rind in the marinade but it was delicious. I made extra marinade and used a different red wine but added smoked sea salt to give it a bit of the Marsala smokiness. I also cooked an assortment of cut up veges under the roast along with the marinade thickened with flour that I had added to the vegetables and browned first before adding the rest of the marinade.",2011-01-17

210289,141610,5,1,I Loved the spices used here.   The only difference I did was to add a bit of fenugreek seed and replace the coriander seed with cardomon. I also soaked the lemons in the boiling water for around five minutes.  I also just tossed the lemon slices in a bowl through the salt on top and stirred.  Then I put them into the jars with the spices ~ same difference.,2007-12-13

Had a bunch of organic oranges to use, and the juice was delicious and pretty sweet, but gave the pie such a lovely orange flavor and color. Wasn't paying attention to the recipe and added the egg yolks to the cold sugar/OJ mixture, then cooked as directed, and it came out fine.

I am just pulling some out of the oven that have added 1/4 teaspoon of butter extract and also some chocolate chips.  These are the peanut butteriest tasting peanut butter cookies that you can make so if you are a fan, do make these.  I found that the sugar can be increased or decreased without any ill effects so feel free to make them a little sweeter or a little less sweet as your tooth dictates.  This recipe can easily be doubled, too.  I am a cookie glutton so I usually get about 10 cookies from this recipe (I make them quite large).  One thing, though...these are the only cookies that I make that I grease my cookie sheet.  They do stick a bit when taking them off of my cookie sheet and because they contain no flour, they are a little fragile until they set up a bit while cooling.",2011-12-26
93026,172684,5,1,"Utterly Scrumptious. I used brown sugar cause I like molasses and I added a ton more vanilla..I just get splashing more in until I liked the taste. I had to drop temp to 325 cause I made them extra large and thick. Be careful not to under cook them if you use the brown sugar they will be a dark cookie. You will need to cook them on either a paper sack, alluminum foil, or parchment and just pull the whole thing off the sheet to cool for best results since they don't firm up until they've cooled off.

However, what we did have was a lovely crisp and very fresh salad made with apples, Blue Stilton, home-grown toasted walnuts and a really wonderful nutty dressing which was 5 star by itself! I made the salad just as posted, with the exception of the celery, and we both enjoyed this for lunch with a glass of wine and some crusty bread.

No more fires on the grill making the brats this way, just a few minutes on there and you have the taste of the grill, and even better the brats don't burst open there either and cause a flame up.

429926,463435,5,1,"This recipe is very similar to one that I have made in the past. However, I loved the fact that it wasn't deep fried. The fact that it is made in muffin pans makes the wanton wrappers so easy to fill as well. This is a great recipe to fix for a get together or a finger food dinner. If you love buffalo wings, but don't care for the messy fingers I suggest you give this recipe a try. I will definitely make this again. Made and reviewed for the AUS/NZ Recipe Swap.",2010-08-23

We really enjoyed it, and I really liked the fact that it was so easy to prepare.  I spent so little time in the kitchen, yet we had a complete meal after only 30 minutes in the oven.  I made it exactly as written, though I have to admit that I used both garlic powder AND minced garlic (3 minced cloves) to suit our taste preferences.  And the ground turkey was such a nice change of pace (from the usual ground beef).  We really enjoyed this.  Made for All New Zaar Cookbooks tag game.

DH said on our way back to the kitchen, 'I really liked that one, I hope your gonna give  it 5 stars' - since I completely agree with him, I did! :) I reduced the meat to 1/2 pound and upped the peas just a smidge - also added some red pepper flakes for a little bit of heat. I included the capers and fresh tomato too. Next time, I'll serve with a nice crusty loaf of bread. Will be making again!",2009-03-03

89586,133933,4,1,"I thought this was a great basic, recipe that I would most definitely make again.  I sauteed the onions and peppers a bit in the oil before adding the hash browns and mixing together, and used homemade hash browns instead of frozen (which I don't think would have made a difference either way).  Otherwise I kept to the basic recipe, not adding anything else, and just quickly ran the pan under the broiler for a few seconds before serving.  Next time, however, I will probably add at least another 1/4 cup of onion. The dish is simple and mild, so keep in mind you might want to add not only meat, but if you prefer, other strongly flavored ingredients like chilies (or whatever your preference).  One of the beautiful things about this recipe is that it can be so easily adjusted to one's own taste.  I would highly recommend it.

I made quick work of slicing the carrots by using my food processor and 4mm blade and I only needed to simmer for an additional 10 min instead of 20 since the carrots were so thin. Other than reducing the oil to 1 teaspoon to save a few calories I didn't change a thing and I wouldn't change a thing the next time either!

I did not have soy oil so I used peanut oil to fry cubes of deboned chicken breast.

This recipe comes from Le Piment Rouge, one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in a beatifully restored former old hotel (Le Windsor) in downtown Montreal.

The ribs sat for 30 minutes and were placed into a 250 degree oven for 2 hours. Fantastic flavor. Thank You!COMING BACK TO ADD:Made this again, Mean, and we rubbed it on boneless pork ribs.  Put them in the oven at 225° for about an hour and 15 minutes.  The flavor is amazing.  We had them with yellow rice and homemade refried beans.

62736,67728,5,1,"Wow, I thought the Mexican Smoked Chile Marinade was my favorite, but this one makes it a tough call(a bit less preparation time for busy days, too). I brined about 2 lbs of boneless chicken breast with your All-Purpose Mild Brine for Poultry and Pork, rubbed it with the Mole Rub, and indoor-grilled it. Incredible! Now I just need to heist my parents' outdoor grill before the summer's over, because I think barbecuing this chicken would simply put it over the top. I'd venture to say that this would do wonderful things for pork sirloin cutlets as well (a project for another day, perhaps).

Personally I find it easier to cut the wedges in half & THEN peel them. I cut down the lemon juice to 1-1.5 T because the first time we found them a tad too acidic. I also use ground rosemary because it adds more flavor without the wood-like pieces of fresh rosemary. Thank you for sharing this recipe!,2010-09-28

It seemed ok & I saw the dry ingredients were not moving, but I walked confidently away. Then the beeping started! The dry ingredients still had not moved & I turned if off. Then it hit me! I used a long-handled spoon to root around among the ingredients & found the kneading paddle had not been attached! I emptied the container contents till I could get to it, cleaned it + the center area & reloaded the ABM. The ingredients were very dry by then, so I added 3 tsp water, turned it on again & it resumed its mission. I never got to add the chives as there was 1 knead & rise b4 baking started.

The first loaf had a few curds, just a few, suspended in the loaf.  Not objectionable but not desirable, either.  The second loaf was better: we emptied the cottage cheese, curds and whey, into a measuring bowl.  We had to add a little yogurt to total the full cup.  Then we added the warm water and whisked the mixture a bit.

We don&#039;t bake in our machine.  After the DOUGH cycle completes, we restart the machine just while we prepare the bread pan.  Then we roll the loaf into the pan and proof.

We didn't add the Green Onions, or the pepper flakes, because I am a total wuss when it comes to spicy stuff.  However, we did add a carrot though and that really added some crunch.  I think next time I am going to try adding some fresh ground peanuts on top as well.  Thanks again for this wonderful recipe, this is going in my arsenal for sure!!",2010-01-01

I preheated my oven to 450 and went ahead and put my cast iron skillet with some olive oil in the oven to get hot. I cooked the chicken for 20 minutes total, 10 minutes per side. I was afraid it would burn but it didn't at all. I think it turned out beautifully, but with summer coming along I'll grill it next time. My boyfriend and I ate it with extra soy sauce on top, with corn and sauteed zucchini. He said I should add it to my regular rotation of meals/list of best recipes! I agree. I love peanutty and Asian flavors together. I tasted the marinade by itself and thought it was reeallly tasty. I would adjust just one thing. I scraped some of the larger globs of marinade off the chicken fearing it would taste too peanut buttery, but next time I will absolutely leave a paste of the marinade on the chicken when cooking.

I did use low-fat plain yoghurt as a substitute for sour cream. I used low-fat milk for the milk/cream option. For the cake, I used 1 1/4 tbsps. of green cardamom(powdered). As for the topping, I used a little over 1/2 tbsp. of green cardamom(powdered). Also, I used almonds for the nuts.

61660,65056,5,1,"Cardamom heaven.  :)  I am a big fan of the exotic-tasting spice, so I didn't find it too strong, unlike carpetsharkmom.  I keep thinking that maybe it could use even more, but honestly, its just right!  I did make a half recipe, which I just cooked in a loaf pan.  It rose very well in my 9x5 loaf pan.  I used whole wheat pastry flour for the flour called for and only added a pinch of salt, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Yum!  My loaf took just short of an hour to bake at 350F.  I followed the advice of Step 13, and put a layer of the topping halfway in the loaf, but don't know if it was worth it- its not particularly visible and it just sort of melted into the rest of the batter.  I used pecans for the nuts, which go really well with the cardamom, IMO.  I just served this as-is and it was great, but I am fantacizing about how spectaular this would be with strawberries and whipped cream.  I will have to make it again once strawberries are in season again and try it.  :)  Very good cake, though.  Dense, as Rita said, and rich.  If you don't like cardamom, don't try this, but if you do, its wonderful!",2004-12-07

I seem to have had some trouble with the topping - I used some in the middle of the cake as suggested, as well as on top, but the part in the middle melted and made dark blotches.

i put two graham crackers on the bottom and they baked into a sort of crust then dolloped with light whipped cream.

Since calories aren't as big of an issue, I also used one egg white and one whole egg, and substituted 1/2 cup half & half, 1/4 whipping cream, and 1/4 milk for the skim milk.  Also, I doubled the amount of cornstarch to make the pie a little sturdier.  It turned out light and creamy, with a beautiful color!",2009-01-10

149363,307214,5,1,Great.  Made in ramekins (about 45 minutes at 325).  I will mostly alter the spices next time and I like less spice and more pumpkin taste.,2010-06-06

149363,1571534,3,0,"Mine came out not so good, but I will give it the benefit of the doubt and round up to 3 stars b/c I substituted Stevia in the Raw for Splenda and i figure that's what the aftertaste must be--either that or the fact that i used an off brand can of pumpkin that had been sitting in the pantry for at least 2 years...  Pie filling was extremely watery and took considerably longer to bake than stated time (i resorted to upping the temp to 375).  The texture improved once it set in the fridge (after I cooled it), but unfortunately, the taste was kind of nasty.  I'm disappointed but I plan to try again with half sugar/half stevia (the other sugar substitutes can make you fat FYI).",2012-11-22
149363,44979937,5,1,i made it using 3/4 Splenda brown sugar and 2% milk. This increased the calories to 118 per slice but it was seriously better than any full fat/full sugar pumpkin pie I have ever had. Used the ramekins as others suggested. The perfect end to thanksgiving meal.,2013-11-30
149363,696423,5,1,This is wonderful and the bonus is that it&#039;s VERY low calorie and virtually sugar free! I made it as written. Splenda is the perfect sweetener for this recipe because there was no after taste and even my sugar loving guests couldn&#039;t tell the difference. I topped each slice with a dollop of whipped cream. DELICIOUS!!,2013-12-01
149363,2001951985,4,1,"I made so many changes it was almost a different recipe, but it turned out great!! And I ate 1/2 the pan in one sitting because I could! Pumpkin is a vegetable right! (Tweaks: 1 full egg instead of 2whites, 1/2c sugar, tapioca starch instead of cornstarch, halved cinnamon &amp; ginger, omitted cloves, added 1tsp pumpkin pie spice. Replaced 1/2 milk with Greek yogurt oh &amp; my can of pumpkin was missing about 1/4 c.) my only complaint was that the bottom of the pie wasn’t set- I’m not sure if it needed more cooking time or something else, but it still tasted great.",2018-01-24

Made just as directed, and the only change I would make in the future is to use a 9x9 pan or double the crust so that the crust is a little bit thicker.  I would like to make these for the bake sale, but the thin crust is too fragile.  The flavor though, it outstanding.  I mixed both the crust and the filling in the food processor.

I made a mistake - when I was measuring the second 1/4 cup of sugar, instead of putting it in the small bowl I had ready to mix up the cinnamon sugar, I dumped it in with everything else - and didn't realize it until I had started mixing.  So I just sprinkled cinnamon on top instead of adding even more sugar.  Next time I'll try to do it right.  Even with the extra sugar mixed in, the two sugar freaks in my family topped this with maple syrup.  Loved it, thanks Jess!",2008-11-10

I made the recipe itself exactly but I baked it in a smaller square glass dish instead of the 9 x 13 recommended.  The pancake puffed up, but I think in a larger pan it wouldn't have been so heavy on the bottom.  It resulted in a thick layer of sweet scrambled eggs, bleh.  And the apples didn't cook through all the way- which makes sense since the pancake was thicker.  I'm going to try this again, but I don't recommend using a smaller pan.  I'll rate it again when I make it with the large pan.  I also think i'll try making this as a savory pancake- using garlic, herbs and veggies instead of sugar, cinnamon and apples.",2008-11-23

229205,487394,5,1,DELICIOUS! I followed a slightly different procedure but the ratio of  ingredients is perfect. Melt the butter in a cast iron pan (make sure it is ultra scrubbed clean; you don&#039;t want an onion after taste!) Add the apples ( I used 3 and did not peel them). Cook until apple begins to soften. Pour the egg mix on top and sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar (I used half because I served the pancake with maple syrup). Put in the oven. 15-18 minutes at 400F.

I melted the fresh butter on the stove and then baked for 25 minutes at 400 and it puffed up so beautifully! Served with raspberry freezer jam a good, strong cup of coffee as you should!

I made another 1/2 recipe, probably not really enough either. But in the oven they went. They stuck to my pan like a son of a gun. However, the flavor and texture was there! After thinking about this recipe I realized it is very similar to a breakfast item called a Dutch Baby. A crepe batter that is poured into a very hot pan with melted butter and baked until puffy and brown. A much wetter batter. So for me this recipe is a keeper. I love that you can have leftovers as my husband takes a lunch every day. I will be making quite often as I can now have a non-fried Relleno, hooorayyy!!!",2011-02-20
103958,456138,5,1,"I made chile rellenos from scratch in a tiny apartment kitchen in 1964. It seemed to take forever and I vowed &quot;Never again&quot; but I&#039;ve been wanting to try one of these chile relleno casseroles. I chose this one, but used a 27 ounce can of whole chiles. Split them and took out the ribs and seeds, laid them in a 9x13 Pyrex buttered pan, put the jack cheese slices on and then another layer of the split chiles, then the batter and cheddar. I mixed the batter with a whisk as I didn&#039;t feel like getting out my electric mixer and that worked fine. Next time I will leave out the cheddar as the dish was a bit cheese intensive for me, and I might try separating the eggs and beating the whites to make a lighter, more traditional batter. These are really good with a little Tabasco Chipotle sauce on top. I made Spanish rice to go with it. Thanks for the recipe! It&#039;s so much easier than making them from scratch.",2013-04-30
103958,482933,5,1,Excellent! But then we are cheeseheads.  LOL!    And so easy.  I beat my eggs while doing rest of recipe.  Mine was not runny.  There are only 3 whole chiles in pan so think there are more like 3 servings. Served ours with cornbread and a bit of Spanish rice.  Muchas  gracias for sharing.,2013-07-22

328473,537937,5,1,"Since I've never had a CliffBar (because they're so costly) I can't compare.  But, if they taste anything like this I can understand the cost.  These are wonderful Reds albeit a bit of a trick to put together.  I used honey for the syrup part and ended up throwing in a splash of maple syrup because it seemed a bit dry.  I'm sure this was because of the almond butter I was using that wasn't blending or melting into the mix well.   I did have to end up using my hands to mix together and then press into an 8x8 inch pan.  I then took your advice and used a square of wax paper to press down firmly.  They still fell apart somewhat upon cutting and getting out of the pan and so I would recommend chilling for at least an hour.  I didn't worry about the crumbliness as I wrap mine in saranwrap and put in the freezer in a big zip-lock bag for whenever.  A great idea for on-the-go.

328473,2001731696,0,0,"These are delicious! They're so much better than brand name clif bars, and you can make them whatever flavor you want. I like to use dried cranberries and top the bars with white chocolate drizzle. I've experimented with how to get the bars to stick together. I use honey and sunflower seed butter, and when I use the amounts listed in the recipe, the bars are always too crumbly. I also use golden brown sugar instead of dark brown sugar, so the moisture content may not be high enough in the sugar to make the bars sticky. I've found that upping the amount of honey to 1/2 or 1/3 cup and adding just a little more sunflower seed butter does the trick. If you want bars closer in texture to a real clif bar, try giving your oats a spin through a blender or magic bullet. I also throw my almonds through the bullet to turn them into powder. If you want to make a chocolate-y bar, add a little bit of cocoa powder to the cereal mixture. You don't want to add too much, though, or you can make the bars bitter.",2017-09-27

287966,724631,3,0,"3 Stars, very good but mild soup, but it was not spicy nor sour enough to be a close replacement for the version sold in good Szechuan restaurants in the U.S. Please see my rating system, I reduce to 3 stars when I believe a recipe needs corrections or clarification. I think the ""chili sauce"" I used was not the ingredient Cook Food Mood intended; she probably meant garlic and red chile paste instead, or I needed to be mindful that Chinese chili sauce is much more potent than my usual Heinz 57 variety. I think this dish usually has julienned pork or ham as opposed to thinly sliced ham (which equates to deli sandwich slices in the U.S.). Oddly, at Whole Foods Market I could not find dried Chinese mushrooms, but I used 8 ounces of beautiful fresh oyster, baby portabella and shitake mushrooms, removing the stems. My soup looked like the restaurant dish, but it lacked the strong taste I usually get at a restaurant. I used a very good quality firm tofu, which worked fine, and DH said he could handle it (just as he does when he eats out!). I used rice salad vinegar because I thought that would be closer to oriental cooking; I did not think that apple cider vinegar was the intended taste.  It may be possible that my rice salad vinegar was too diluted and I should have purchased Chinese rice vinegar.  I used a regular sake for the Chinese wine. If Cook Food Mood revises or clarifies the ingredients, I would be happy to re-make this soup and re-review. Made for Fall 2008 Pick-a-Chef.",2008-09-29

173677,111075,5,1,My first pectinless jam and it came out perfectly!  I halved the recipe and omitted the butter.  I sliced the strawberries fairly thinly and layered them in the pot covering each layer with some sugar.  I cooked the fruit over a moderate heat stirring continuously.  At 20 minutes the jam was still fairly syrupy and not nearly thick enough for my tastes so I continued cooking it until I came to the consistency I liked.  This added another 10 minutes of cooking time but it was well worth it!  The jam was wonderfully thick and the fruit had been pulversized sufficiently by all the stirring.  The lemon brings out the strawberry flavour beautifully.  This is also perfectly sweetened - not sickly sweet and sticky as some jams can be.  I will make this same recipe with other fruits and I am sure I will have great results with them as well.,2010-04-24

I redid the process w/ more pectin then it came out okay.  I was so frustrated and vowed to never do again.  Well, strawberries were cheap and my son practically lives on PB and Strawberry jelly so I figured I should attempt it again.  Since its 1 year later and strawberries are 99 cents a pound I thought lets try again. I looked for a new recipe to try and came across this one and thought awesome no pectin.

I also added the rind of the lemon to make it thicker.,2011-06-22

This being said I cut back on the sugar, I should have used 8 cups total and I used 4. It is very sweet as the strawberries where at their peak.

228751,482933,4,1,"Healthy, attractive, versatile, and another tasty way to use summer squash.  The directions are rather confusing b/c the order of the ingredient list does not match the order of the ingredients within the directions and I think it has something to do with the filling being listed last instead of in the middle of the ingredient list.  In Step 1 I cut the squash in half lengthwise.
In Step 4 I used a large skillet instead of a baking dish-everything is done on top of the stove.  In Step 4 I also doubled the tomato slices and sort of wished I had increased it more as the cooked tomato tastes great with this!  I used half as much squash as listed and that was plenty.  Probably makes a big difference in how big the squash is-remember it needs to fit in the skillet.  I subbed catsup for the tomato paste, omitted the mint due to personal preferences, and doubled the lemon juice in Step 6 and wish I had increased the garlic, too.

107642,797028,5,1,"We have been making these for our annual gift bags and trays ever since it appeared in Taste of Home. Delicious and rich. Here are several additional tips to make this experience a pleasant one. 1). Much easier with 2 people working together. 2). We cut pieces of wax paper that are approx. 3"" x 6"" and then fold them in half so they are 3"" square. 3). One person rolls the dough balls while the other person places a ball between the waxed paper sheet and flattens with the bottom of a glass. Set aside. 4). Make sure that the cherries are as dry as possible. We drain on paper towels and blot as much liquid off as possible. 5). Separate a dough ""circle"" from the waxed paper, place in palm of hand, center a cherry stem side up and mold the dough to cover. 6). Make sure the cherry is ENTIRELY covered with the chocolate dough prior to dipping. Thank you Courtly for posting. I usually have to search high and low for that Taste of Home magazine.",2008-12-04

The only drawback is that I found it quite a bit heavier in texture than commercially made pastry, due to my first attempt perhaps ???

I would suggest using 2oz soy sauce, 2 or 3oz teriyaki sauce, 2 to 4 drops sesame oil, a good knob of ginger and my be a little sugar, honey, or molasses. I noticed that the sauce that I get from our local Chinese restaurant is a little on the sweet side. I love it. When I try this I'll let ya know how it turns out.

I love the fact that it has so much ginger in it, which I grated frozen on my Microplane zester.  I used lemon juice instead of the rose water/lime option, dates as opposed to raisins, and instead of 1/2 cup of pumpkin seeds I just upped the pistachios to 1 1/2 cups and used a handful of sunflower seeds.

Also, the type of flour used may require a little bit more liquid. I shaped the bread by lightly kneading on a floured surface, brushed with olive oil and added only a 1/2 cup of walnuts. I personally wouldn't omit the walnuts, they added a nice crunch to the bread.  I will try baking the bread next time in a preheated cast iron skillet. Thanks for posting.",2007-01-17

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I added even more walnuts (I wouldn't suggest omitting them either as other reviewers said, they provide wonderful crunch and flavor!), and the spices were perfect. Because of its dense texture it was a little heavier than I would have liked for an appetizer or side dish, but still tasted great.

9757,56251,5,1,"This is excellent, and so easy.  I cooked my broccoli in the microwave and then added it too the the rest of the ingredients, and baked, so good, the velveeta gets nice and creamy, the nice topping of ritz crackers and butter made a nice little crunch.  We loved it!",2010-06-30

I served it with some fresh fruit.  I think I would have enjoyed it more the the type of prosciutto I asked to get or a high quality sliced ham.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

182906,801264,5,1,Wow! This flan was soo creamy and dense. It reminds me a lot of Philippine leche flan. I think this recipe has just the right ratio of egg yolks and egg. I didnâ€™t even miss the cinnamon thatâ€™s usually added to Mexican flan. Next time I plan on using a can of coconut milk instead of the can of evaporated milk for variation .

I used a thick creamy Cesar dressing in place of ranch, spread it on the tortilla to help stick the edges together after rolling. I crammed as many veggies on the four tortilla I had on hand. The trick it to slice stuff up as thin as possible.  *red onions, avocado sliced, romaine, seedless cukes,  slices of cheddar, chicken, crumbled blue cheese and LOADS of bacon.

It turned out perfect. Just the right amount of heat for me, but for someone who doesn't like spice you may want to cut back on the crushed red pepper. I think it would also be good with jalapeno's instead of the green pepper, so I might try that next time. It's not really a soup, and not really a casserole, just good comfort food.

It was mild and not &quot;cabbage-y smelling&quot;. It was easy to do and the touch of sherry was genius. I do believe that one &quot;new&quot; ingredient made a huge difference.

Since I never have bran on hand, I just put in more oats...used sliced almonds in place of pecans...and a mix of organic jumbo flame raisins, chopped dried apricots, and dried cranberries.

This is something that I'll make a lot, including to have available around here as a breakfast jam...mmmm!!.  I did add a bit more allspice and added some cinnamon.  The red jalapenos look gorgeous in this mixture.  I also used two bags of frozen peaches, thawed and didn't puree, just let everything boil away together until very tender and thick, stirring very often, then mashing with my potato masher into small chunks.  I would imagine this could be poured into freezer canning containers and frozen successfully longer than a month.  In any case, this one is truly delicious, versatile, and fun to make.

76193,39835,5,1,Delicious and easy--a perfect combination for desert! I cheated a bit by using a frozen pie crust and regular milk chocolate chips which still resulted in a pie that had us fighting for the last piece and licking the pie dish clean.

I used chicken broth in the polenta, and finished it with parmesan cheese.  I didn't have any zucchini, so I substituted orange bell pepper and large chucks of onion, which we thought were great.  Next time I think I'll add artichoke hearts as well.  Our only complaint about this recipe was that the sauce ended up being too liquidy.  The tomatoes basically disintegrated, leaving a lot of flavor, but no substance, and we would have liked this a bit more chunky.  Overall, very good, and I'll definitely make again.

The &quot;caramel&quot; sauce, seemed to drown the popcorn, and although the extra liquid evaporated in the oven, it turned Cracker-Jack brown and I ended up taking it out in about a half-hour. The texture is different than regular caramel corn, and so is the flavor (although, the flavor wasn't too bad). I think, considering the price of Swerve, I will not be trying this one again. And so I move onward, in my quest for sugar-free caramel corn. Thanks, anyway.",2017-06-27

I added about 2 Tbsp of lemon juice along with the olive oil and this salad was excellent!!! It tastes just like the one I get at our local Lebanese restaurant.

I would rate this recipe 5* if it included the lemon juice.",2009-01-11
218542,607820,4,1,Thank you for this recipe.  It was the basis for a great salad.  I added the same amount of lemon juice as oil and upped the sumac to 1 tbs.  Try it this way and you will LOVE this salad.,2009-02-01

Colourful and fresh, it was a great accompaniment to a buffet lunch, and I got DS to do the chopping!

Really liked this, FloWer, and I am not generally a big salad fan!  Thanks for a lovely recipe.",2009-11-23
218542,593927,4,1,"Fine but nothing special. I know it is not traditional but even my local Lebanese restaurant leaves out the pita bread sometimes and I did have to as we are gluten free. I think chunks of carrot are not good in salad as they are so hard compared to other ingredients (for example I think a poor combo is carrots and tomatoes). I grated mine, still the cruddy carrots from the regular grocer with hardly any flavour, no lettuce on hand, I used Lebanese cucumbers which I peeled (wax/pesticides), wonderful tomatoes, extra sumac, cold pressed extra virgin olive oil, sea salt to taste and some freshly squeezed lemon juice as I had some ready and other reviewers said I should, plus the rest of the ingredients. I'd try another recipe next time.",2012-06-22

162479,60260,5,1,Great recipe and a breeze to make.  I served with fuji and granny smith apple slices along with crackers.  My favorite was the apples and they looked really nice ringed around the cheese.  The taste improves as it comes to room temp.  (To keep the apples from browning I gave them a quick dip in pineapple juice and let them dry.  They stayed perfect for days.)

I'm just not big on the taste of store bought loaf bread. Maybe that's where I went wrong because this was super dry, even though the apples were in a thin liquid (like the previous reviewer stated).

384266,227978,4,1,"I topped a grilled cod fillet with this Kiwi Salsa, and it was great. The cranberries and kiwi provided a nice touch of soft texture and sweetness set against the more blandly-flavored and crunchy texture of the jicama. I thought about removing some of the jicama, but I feared losing some of that lovely lime juice (since the diced jicama is first marinated in lime juice). We used the extra salsa to use with some tortilla chips, but I think it really shines as a topper for meat/fish/poultry. I'd like to try it with pork as I think the cranberries would be a natural match with a few nicely grilled or broiled pork chops.",2009-08-22
384266,1330126,4,1,"The sweet and sour combination of the cranberries and kiwi went together really well. The jalapeno gave the salsa a nice little kick.

The soufflÃ© was not cooked through even after about an additional 15 minutes in the oven nor did it rise well.  The successful version was cooked in a 5 oz ramekin.  The mushrooms were lightly sautÃ©ed with Canadian bacon.  Freshly grated parmesan cheese was used and a few snips of fresh chives were whisked in.

I used double the olive oil and a larger onion and let the onion brown nicely before adding the garlic.  Then I added the kale, and when it was pretty wilted - but still not droopy, I added 1-2 tsp of balsamic vinegar and it was excellent.  Thank you!",2010-02-10

I have to say it wasn't as bad as I remember. I doubt that the kale I ate as a child was seasoned with much more than salt & pepper. The garlic, onion, balsamic vinegar with a dash of salt & pepper made this a very tasty dish that I would make again. Thanks for posting!",2010-04-17

I cut them in half lengthwise then chopped then into maybe thumb sized pieces. I sauteed them a bit before adding the onion. I was using minced garlic from a jar so I added that right before the kale. I should have added some water or something to help the kale cook down. It seemed still a bit raw but still edible.

It did take longer than half an hour for the meat to be tender--more like an hour.  I would love to try it in a slow cooker.  Also, the recipe makes a little too much sauce for the amount of meat and onions in it. So, I have made these alterations:  8 - 10 pieces of bacon,1 1/2 - 2 lbs of round steak, a large onion,  2 cloves of garlic, 2 10 oz cans of soup (I prefer golden mushroom to cream of shroom), light sour cream to taste.  Be sure to cook the onion and meat in the bacon drippings.  The bacon and paprika give this such a unique and delicious flavor!  This will be the beef stroganoff recipe I use from now on!

I also didn't use any egg, since it looked like my fish was wet enough for the cornmeal to stick, but when I flipped the fish some of the breading came off, so maybe I should have used it after all.

This catfish has at least given me back some of the foods I was raised on without the oil, etc.  This catfish came out so tender, so flavorful, that we didn&#039;t miss any salt content or oil from not deep frying the fish as we have for over 30 years.  Very easy to put together,  cook time is right on, and the flavor made this dixie chic very happy that she doesn&#039;t have to give up all the foods that she grew up on and loves (and of course, most importantly, that won&#039;t kill my husband in the process).

My only variation to the recipe was to use soy milk instead of cows milk.  Still worked perfectly.  I'm always in a hurry (2 small kids do that) so each time have dumped it all together and thrown it in the fridge to thicken up.  Does the trick and makes it smooth and spreadable.",2008-04-15
23312,553587,4,1,"I've been making a vanilla version of this for many years.  For those who said to use less milk, I'm guessing that you didn't cook the milk mixture long enough.  It should be sort of like glue.  If you are gluten-free, this also works with corn starch--try 3 T.  For some reason, while this recipe works, I prefer to put the sugar with the butter and cream for about 8-10 minutes.  The granular sugar will disappear; I like the texture it provides to the frosting.  Last, you can substitute chocolate; I used milk chocolate tonight and it was delicious.  I only used 1 T of cocoa to keep it from getting to dark tasting.  I used 3/4 c sugar, as the recipe says.  If I were making it with semi-sweet, I might want to go with 1 cup.",2009-03-15

Instead of deepfrying them,  I lined the wonton wrapper in a mini muffin pan and sprayed them.  Then added the filling.  Twisted the tops of the wontons. Baked them at 425 for about 5-8 minutes.  Just until they started to brown. Then I took them out and they were great.  The fillng is really good.  Next time,  I will add just a bit of parsley, and maybe some roasted garlic to smooth out the edges a bit.  But overall the recipe is great.  I froze all but the two I ate to try.

The chocolate chips really add something special to the bread, giving it depth that makes regular banana bread boring.  I can see how this would be a great gift for kids at college.

I loved the way this worked out both in terms of texture and flavor.  The parsnips and carrots are less mushy than the potaotoes so you get these sweet little bites mixed among the creamy potatoes. As a result each bite is a little different -- so you taste each of the components as well as the dish as a whole.  My particular combination was 2 cups potatos, 1 cup white turnips, 2 cups parsnips and 1 cup of carrots. I used light butter in mine.  Don't whip these, you'll loose half the fun of the dish!  Thanks!",2006-11-12

I'd say 3 to 4 make a serving, but I'm a big guy with a man's apetite to match.  I've never really cared for pancakes because most of them are heavy and dense and have a metalic aftertaste I don't care for.  ebelskivers  are, to me, what pancakes always wanted to be but never managed to pull off.  The ebelskivers<br/> are served (at least in my wife's family) by splitting in half, filling with something, then eating them whole.  Fillings can include cinnamon sugar, your favorite jam or jelly, maple syrup, or my favorite; scrambled eggs with bacon or cooked sausage scrambled in and maple syrup poured over the top.  Yes, you need a special pan to make these, but it is SO worth it!!  My bro-in-law used chopsticks to turn the ebelskivers as they cooked, so there's an idea for the beginner.  Folks...get the pan, take care of it as you would any cast iron, make these, and get creative with the fillings...it's fun and delicious all at once.",2012-04-09

I have never ground oatmeal in my food processor so I was a little tentative. It worked beautifully and I believe contributed to the nice texture of the cookies. Most definitely different but incredibly delicious. Thanks KitchenManiac.,2004-05-10
76895,155886,5,1,OMG...I can't believe I forgot to review this recipe!  These were absolutely heavenly!  The kahlua adds such a unique  and pleasing flavor.  I have made these twice now with rave reviews! Betcha can't eat just one!  Thank you!    ,2004-10-18

225056,121684,5,1,"Wow! Does this pack a flavour punch!  I changed the method Peter used, slightly.  I had two good sized steaks but used the full quantity of marinade.  I used brown sugar instead of palm sugar.  I marinaded the steaks in ALL the marinade, then shook them off and cooked them in a little oil and butter, then set them aside and kept warm.  Then I added all the marinade to the pan and cooked it over a high heat until reduced to a sticky caramel consistency - watching carefully to make sure the sauce didn't burn.  I threw the steaks back in briefly to coat, then served them with the remaining sauce poured over them.  I accompanied them with diced baked potatoes and a simple lettuce and tomato salad. The sauce was slightly reminiscent of honey/soy chicken but with a dominant orange flavour.  It was a very strong flavour but we loved it!  Not for those who like bland food, but, for us, totally fabulous!  Thanks for 'discovering' this Jen T, and for trying it out Peter J!",2007-04-28

Now he's watching baseball.  I used demerara sugar and 3 cloves of garlic for two huge porterhouse steaks.  Marinated for 5 hours.  The taste of orange was immediately noticeable, then it disappeared, followed by savory sweetness from soy sauce, garlic, porter mustard, and sugar.

I liked the taste of the marinade a sweetness came through in each bite.  My DH did not care for it though because of the sweetness. Perhaps I will cut back on the sugar portion by 1/2 and use this recipe again on steak but will use full strength on other meats. The flavors for me were great.

I cooked them up then put them on a cookie tray and put my timer on for 20 minutes until they were partially frozen, then bagged them!

242966,13026061,0,0,"I, too, keep bacon always fried up for use in chocolate cakes, chocolate chip cookies, omelets and just plain ol&#039; scrambled eggs, however, so that the bacon doesn&#039;t shrink so much I do it a bit different.  I cut the bacon in 1/4&quot; strips while still partially frozen, then place each strip on its side in a skillet set on low medium and cover tightly.  After 15 minutes, I separate the pieces and continue to cook with the lid on another 15-20 minutes.  Then I take the lid off and keeping the same temperature, let it cook about 30 more minutes.  By &quot;sweating&quot; the bacon, the juices will keep the bacon plumped up and the same size.  When crisp I drain it and keep the drippings for other uses.

I do want to share that if you prefer to remove the tails and not butterfly the shrimp  (lay the shrimp down instead of placing them tail side up), there is absolutely no loss in flavor; in fact, this is simply wonderful prepared either way although the way its written is more showy!

In step #6 there is mention of pouring the remaining marinade over the shrimp - what leftover marinade? The other steps don't mention holding any marinade back so I didn't get that part. Also, there seems to be far too much butter. My shrimp were swimming in butter part way thru the cooking so I drained it off and continued on.

I've made similar dishes with similar ingredients, but they've all used apple cider, so I was interested to see what using concentrated apple juice would do.  First, it makes a wonderful marinade - the pork took on a beautiful color and glaze, and the flavor definitely seeped into the meat because I could taste the subtle sweetness of it when I ate it.  The pork came out PERFECTLY.  The apple juice concentrate also provided a nice punch of apple flavor to the sauce, which was so good and so simple to eat!

I first used two Fat Daddio's pans which have to be adjusted already because they are anodized, dropping between 25-75 degrees. I am very sad to say the majority of the cake was cornbread like..right on...it was OVER DONE. You ask how I know this...the center was as perfect as I could of even imagine! I used the left over batter and filled up a FD pan 4x4x3 and cooked it at about 250-275 (older gas range) perhaps the density on top of the heat is causing it to cook quicker (kind of like with the whole dome concept) which took even longer but it was amazing! Bev I would have to agree with, as I was snacking on the middle pieces I was like, lemon icing YUM!! It would be so much more helpful if you could adjust the size of the pans instead of the servings.

I used homemade low fat ricotta (pureed to make it smoother), real sugar, pureed and strained fresh strawberries along with the sliced ones, and opted for the almond extract.  These looked beautiful, and we all thought the taste and the texture were terrific.  Thanks for anothr great recipe, Toni!",2008-05-01

124144,957625,4,1,"Every year, I make my hubs creme brulee for Valentine's Day. Unfortunately, due to doctor's orders, that extra-cholesteroly goodness was out of the question this year. I opted to make this instead and it hit many of the same buttons as creme brulee: sweet, smooth inside with a top that gives a bit of resistance. I made the actual souffle per the recipe, except for using regular cane sugar, and used vanilla extract. I also topped it with homemade lemon curd and a few sliced strawberries. They baked 28 minutes and, once I pulled them from the oven, I let them sit in the water bath for another 10. This recipe was much easier to make than I'd thought souffle would be, and the end result was very tasty. I dropped a star because: 1) I could've at least doubled the vanilla. I couldn't taste it at all. It'd also up the ""faux brulee"" quotient. 2) I also didn't get any ""cheesecake"" vibe from this, either in taste or texture, and I got a definite ""EGG"". I have to wonder how this would work out with whipped, slightly thinned light cream cheese? Cheesecake flavored yogurt? Mmmm... Overall, this is a GREAT recipe that will just require minor tweaking to satisfy my palette. The hubs gave it 5 stars, however.",2010-02-15
82625,125520,0,0,Hey Jude. I am from Kentucky and  have been eating burgoo all my life. I have never heard of adding squirrel. The Churches is this area sell burgoo by the gallons at their summer picnics. My husband and I just made 15 gallons ourselves. Our recipe is quite different from yours. I liked this one but it tasted more like a soup.,2004-02-10
82625,1634,0,0,"Here in Central Minnesota, where the stew is called BOUJA, we put a handful of Pickling spices into a mesh bag and leave it there until the taste is almost addictive. But, the the meats and vegetable collection looks about right.

I think the decision about squirrel meat depends on their diet. If those critters have been living on Pine Cones, they can spoil a pot of stew real quick.

My SIL immediately asked for the recipe and plans to make it when she gets home, my DD#2 wants me to make another one already and even DH is talking about it.  The ranch dressing is very tasty and the bacon goes great with it.  We did discuss putting half of the bacon in the cheeseball and then using the other half to roll it in to distribute the bacon flavor more.  All in all a great recipe and one that will definitely be repeated in this family.  Thanks for posting.",2004-07-05

This was the bowl that everyone kept saying what is that? I must have that recipe.  I did make one slight change, but it was really good anyway.  I did not enough cheddar cheese, so I used a combo of cheddar, and 6 cheese italien blend.  This was quite addicting stuff.  Great recipe",2005-01-01

I used reduced fat margarine and low fat sour cream but otherwise kept to the recipe.  Of course, I was rubbish at getting it neatly out of the baking dish.  So, it ended up being more like mushroom and onion mashed potatoes on the plate but they tasted really good.  Very filling and really pretty budget friendly too.  I could see adding more of the filling and sprinkling some cheese on the top and making it a veggie main dish at some point.  Made for PAC Fall 2008.",2008-09-18

I rolled them into 1 tsp sized mini balls, rolled them to coat w/the bacon bits.  Once they were refrigerated and firm, I added a toothpick to each ball and served them with a Nabisco Sociable Cracker under each ball.  There were lots of other appy's at the party to choose from and these were gone in less than an hour.  I probably got about 100 mini balls out of this recipe.  Addicting little things!

I made this tonight for dinner for DH and myself, with the zucchini from my overstocked garden. Although I think my zucchini was more than 4 inches long, I had just enough filling for them. I already had the cooked beef in the freezer, so that was a big time saver. I made the recipe as stated, and used feta cheese on four, and Parm cheese on the other four.

HOWEVER, there are several plusses to this recipe which I'll try again. No doubt Nestle has some terrific recipes & this one could easily be adjusted to personal taste by switching chips or experimenting with the cheesecake a bit. Having your own personal cheesecake complete with crust is just plain fun & indulgent. And speaking of fun, this is a terrific recipe to get kids in the kitchen to help out.

152441,274719,5,1,"For not being a big of carrots, I sure gobbled these down quick.  I used honey flavored butter instead of regular and fresh ginger instead of dried.  I will be making this again and again!",2007-05-01
152441,295565,1,0,I followed this recipe exactly and there was absolutely no flavour.  Sorry.  Didn't like it.  :(,2007-05-21
152441,227607,5,1,Made these for ZWT 07...The kids loved them and want me to make them again tomorrow.  Very yummy way to get the kids to eat their carrots.  I think I used a little more brown sugar than called for.,2007-05-25
152441,219318,4,1,"These were quick and easy to throw together, and I thought the butter and ginger flavors came through very well.  It needed more brown sugar though.  But that might have been my fault.  I wasn't sure whether to firmly pack the brown or not, so I measured it somewhere in between.   Made for Zaar World Tour III.",2007-05-27
152441,394604,5,1,"I have made these little beauties a couple of times so far. They taste great. I used baby carrots the first time and regular sliced carrots the second. The ginger makes the recipe, in my opinion. They are mighty tasty and I think the kiddies would like these, too.",2007-05-28

I sliced the carrots in half and baked them in the oven for 40 mins at 190oC and when they were finished cooking I poured the ""dressing"" over the carrots.  They tasted wonderful, Little Miss (DD) really enjoyed them she wanted second serving.  Thank you Mama's Kitchen for posting your recipe",2007-05-28

152441,231054,5,1,"So simple, but so, so good.  I didn't double the sauce -- but I think I was a little short on the amount of carrots I used, so it worked fine.  But if I have the entire pound of carrots, I think I'll do as others suggested and double the sauce -- it's certainly yummy enough to have double the amount!!!",2007-05-29
152441,183964,5,1,A very nice dish. There's a lot of flavor here! These went along very nicely with Charmies corned beef brisket. I cooked the carrots in the brisket broth and the pickling spice added a very nice flavor. A perfect side for your next corned beef meal. Try them!,2007-05-30
152441,324621,4,1,These were pretty good. Made them to go with our steak and shrimp dinner along with some seasoned pasta and fresh honeydew melon. Very nice meal and these carrots were a lovely addition!,2007-05-30

152441,199848,5,1,"Sweet with a hint of ginger.  Just perfect.  These are great for kids and ""grown-up"" enough for adults.  I may have used a bit extra ginger; I didn't measure it.  Thanx for sharing this.  I'll be making these again.",2007-06-14
152441,353579,5,1,"This has plenty of great reviews, but I'll chime in with one more.  I make glazed carrots often, but the addition of just a bit of ginger sets this apart and I'll definitely add it next time I make them.  Thanks for sharing, mama!",2007-06-17

152441,103876,5,1,Very good carrots!  This recipe is simple to make and the flavor of the sauce really compliments the carrots.  I used baby carrots and fresh ginger.  My daughter was still eating the leftovers after dinner was over.  I think that's a good sign!,2007-07-01

152441,442988,4,1,"Very good.  It was a bit too sweet for my tastes -- I found the natural sugar in the carrots didn't need that much extra richness.  Next time I'll cut the sugar/butter glaze in half for the same amount of carrots, so it's just the slightest hint of extra sweetness.  Thanks for a good recipe!",2007-07-05

152441,339260,5,1,"These carrots are superb!  I had a 1 lb bag of baby carrots left over from a veggie tray I made for by DIL's baby shower.  I did an ingredient search for carrots to find a different way to use these up.  I like glazed carrots and I like ginger.  When I read this recipe, I knew I couldn't go wrong.  I use an extra tablespoon of brown sugar, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  These were the best glazed carrots that I have ever had.  The ginger and the brown sugar are a wonderful combination.  I am putting this recipe in my binder of ""special"" recipes.  I would like to try these with fresh, grated ginger root as some of the others suggested.  Thanks for another amazing recipem, mama!",2007-07-23

Great!!!,2007-09-01
152441,566275,5,1,Simplicity itself.  Would probably increase the ginger next time.,2007-09-04
152441,473347,5,1,"Wow! This was amazing. I can't stand ginger normally but this converted me. I steamed the carrots and whipped up some rice. And I mixed the rice and coated carrots together. A great, filling, fairly healthy meal (better than the potato chips I was going to eat). For a little kick I added some crushed red peppers. I will take this recipe with me when I head off to college.",2007-09-11

152441,88569,4,1,"These were good, the rest of the family liked them better than I did. I think next time I will add a bit more brown sugar and only use 1/4 t. of ginger (I usually like ginger but the taste was quite strong). Great twist on carrots, thanks!",2007-10-18
152441,446738,5,1,Very tasty!  I added just a little bit of kosher salt for a little more flavor.  Husband and daughter loved them.,2007-11-18

152441,202431,1,0,Looks like I am definately in the minority here. I followed the recipe exactly and even steamed the carrots hoping to lock in the flavor but the end result was not at all what I expected... just simply had no taste. Sorry but I won't be making these again.,2008-03-12
152441,369715,4,1,These are good and easy to make. I used canned carrots as that is all I had tonight and needed a quick side dish. I followed the recipe as written. Everyone enjoyed these. Thanks for a different way to make carrots.,2008-03-12

152441,362983,5,1,"Yummy! I always use carrots with other vegetables, so it was nice to use just carrots and make something very simple yet tasty at the same time! I sliced my carrots and sauteed them till they softened. A bit of water helped them along as well. I think I'll probably add more ground ginger next time since I think I added a touch less than recommended, or try fresh ginger for a nice little kick. I might microwave the carrots next time like other reviews have suggested and see how it compares time-wise. Hmm maybe some honey instead of brown sugar.. or even some herbs. Oh the possibilities.. :) Thanks for a lovely recipe!",2009-02-04

152441,719083,5,1,This is how we like to cook our carrots and is my favorite type of carrots. We don't normally put ginger in but I had some so I chopped up finely (as MollyJ mentioned) and used that in there. This is just a nice easy way to give carrots some flavor. Thanks!,2009-06-19

152441,1049724,5,1,"I followed Mama's recipe and found that I prefer the less saucy version - to keep it healthy. The kids liked it, it was easy to make - I steamed baby carrots, then mixed them into a bowl with the brown sugar, butter and ground ginger.  Because the butter was not melted yet, I mixed what I could and then added the hot carrots, which then dissolved and turned the mix into the sauce.  I will be making this again.",2009-08-26
152441,633027,5,1,Very yummy!  Made these to go with dinner last night.  I used 1/2 lb of the frozen crinkle cut carrots.  I kept the sauce ingredients at 2 tbsp brown sugar and 2 tbsp margarine but decreased the ginger to 1/4 tsp which was plenty for my family's tastes. I'll definitely  increase the sauce ingredients in the future to make it more 'saucy' though.  I also think next time I'll try subbing cinnamon for the ginger because my family likes cinnamon on carrots and I think it will work well with this method.  Thanks for posting!!!!!!!!,2009-10-04

152441,1007259,0,0,"I cooked these a bit differently - mixed up the butter, sugar, and ginger, tossed raw carrots in it, and roasted them.  Maybe ground ginger doesn't hold up well to the heat, but I couldn't really taste it at all.  Since it might be my fault, I won't rate it, but I wanted to warn anyone else hoping to roast carrots this way.",2009-12-02

Neither of us particularly like cooked carrots, but these are the exception! I steamed the carrots and microwaved the butter, brown sugar and ground ginger for 30 seconds. Then, I drained the water from the pan, added the carrots and sauce and voila! A ridiculously easy, DELICIOUS one-pot side! The ginger flavor isn't obvious, but gives these something extra.",2009-12-13

152441,333017,5,1,I have made something similar to this but used mustard instead of the ginger.  I quite liked the ginger/butter combination. I made this up the day ahead of time...undercooked the carrots a bit and placed them in the crockpot for about an hour.  Loved it!!  I will definately use this recipe again!!,2010-04-01

I did add a small dash of cinnamon, just because that smelled right. My DD and I still agree that even with a sweet sugar coating, carrots are the most vile, evil vegetable ever created. ;) I will be making this again. One day, I may even taste it!

152441,344087,5,1,Thank you!!! I hated cooked carrots until now. Temporary following a low residue diet and need to eat well cooked or canned vegetables with no skin. I had some canned ones in the pantry that I knew I should use or donate. I made the sauce in a small skillet and tossed the drained carrots and heated till warm. I also added a little sauce to my plain white rice and it was very nice for a change. This would be great for the microwave or to make camping as it is super easy!!!,2011-07-30

240291,726266,5,1,I absolutely loved this recipe! The house really does smell great while it's cooking. This will be added to our regular rotation of dinners. Even my kids ages 3 and 1 ate it up. Wonderful!,2008-01-30

240291,311625,4,1,"The flavor of the sauce was great, but we only gave four stars because it didn't meld into the meat very well. I had to leave the yogurt out (milk allergy) but we didn't find it too spicy at all even without. Thanks Lisa!",2009-07-05

78991,74342,5,1,Talk about easy!!!  This recipe certainly is.  I recently ate something similar to this at a pot luck and was looking for a recipe.  I used the cheddar cheese on top and liked it.  I also plan to try using a different flavor stuffing mix.,2004-07-13
78991,88060,5,1,Very Delicious dish. The whole family enjoyed it.I covered the top with Colby Jack fine shredded cheese. Was making cheesy garlic biscuits so I cooked it at 375 degrees. No burning at all. ,2004-07-31

78991,20375,5,1,A very good casserole!  My family loved it.  We ate it all up...no leftovers.  I used cream of chicken soup and added some extra cheddar cheese to the stuffing mixture. I also used a 2 quart round dish instead of the 9X11 dish.  We will definatly be making this again.  I'd probably double it though because my mom and I ate almost the entire thing tonight.,2005-02-13
78991,221416,4,1,"This was very simple to make and very tasty but a little dense with too predominant a stuffing flavour for me.  My husband loved it and I would definitely make this again. I will increase the chicken and use a little less soup.  Thanks for this one, it's a keeper.",2005-08-28

462118,724516,5,1,"Mmmm! this was yummy, I made it to the recipe with the exception of the green tomato as I didn't have any. I just upped the red which might change the carbs a wee bit, other than I followed the recipe it was very nice.

But, made some enhancements...used mild Italian sausage, added a can of sliced black olives, a can of mushrooms and increased the amount of mozzarella to a cup. Obviously these changes increased the fat and calorie content, but not the carb content significantly. Will make this again very soon.",2013-01-13
462118,632249,5,1,"Just delicious!  I omitted the green tomato and used two small zucchini. (I drained the zucchini after microwaving them.) I thought that it needed a bit more sauce, so I upped that by about 1/3 C but I didn&#039;t take into account that the zucchini would lose more water as it cooked so really the sauce amount would have been fine as written.  DH and I were surprised how similar it tasted to lasagna, we did not miss the pasta at all.  Perfect for SB diet! Thanks for sharing your recipe!",2013-06-10

462118,2000467630,5,1,This has become a staple at our house. I changed the ground beef to Hot Italian Turkey sausage. I buy the links and cut the casing. The dish has more spice with just the addition of the sausage.,2016-12-21
368962,324390,5,1,This was way to good and so easy to prepare! The crust is really buttery and had a caramel flavor from the brown sugar. The sourcream mixture bakes into a cake layer and then there is a thin layer of struesel. I made half a recipe and used an 8x8 pan. It kind of had the texture of brownies and it was about the same thickness too. I bet this would be great packed in a lunch box or warm from the oven with a bit of vanilla ice-cream.

368962,60716,5,1,"Love this coffee cake! We liked the crust, and the cake came out so moist. The only nuts I had in the house were dry roasted peanuts so I crushed them for the topping. Delicious! Made for ZWT6: No-Nonsense Nibblers.",2010-05-24
368962,67728,5,1,"Great unusual coffee cake! I was tempted to add more butter to the crust mixture because it was so powdery that I didn't think it would stick together when baked, but I'm really glad that I didn't. I loved the sugary texture of the crust in comparison to the soft moist cake part. Because I was doing some pantry weeding this weekend, I chopped up some whiskey praline peanuts for the topping, and I used some Pampered Chef Sweet Cinnamon Sprinkle in place of the plain cinnamon sugar mixture. I'd definitely make this again! Thanks for posting! :)  Made for The Queens of Quisine for ZWT6 Germany",2010-06-01

I only added 1TB granulated sugar because I don't like it too sweet; I could easily have omitted that sugar altogether & not hurt the recipe at all. I tried cutting back on the whipped cream - no, I needed all 1 1/2c whipped to cover the 11x7 pan of sweet potatoes.  I *did* only use 2TB (not 1/4c) brown sugar on the top & it was nicely coated.

As with most gardens now we have tons of zucchini, and this is the answer to a quick fix meal, that begs to grab em' hot off the grill. Wow, Peter! These are simply aromatic to smell, and just as tasty to devour as much as you want. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used my mandoline to cut these in long strips about 1/4 inch thick. I mixed them with thinly sliced onion, some fresh thyme, dill, and chives from the garden. I also mixed with some garlic powder and seasoned black pepper. Absolutely delicious!

201058,239758,5,1,"Such a simple recipe -- such great results. Peter, this really does do justice to zucchinis. I didn't read the instructions carefully, so made the recipe back-to-front (my dad used to say -- open the box and throw away the poop sheet, so oops!). Anyway, this is what I did do. I brushed both sides of the zucchinis with a mixture of olive and sesame oil, then sprinkled on the herbs. I cooked them for a little longer than 3 minutes each side, because my zucchini halves were quite thick. Also sprinkled a bit of parmesan on the cut sides, after they were cooked. My photos show before and after. Thanks so much for giving zucchinis a good reputation.",2007-09-09
