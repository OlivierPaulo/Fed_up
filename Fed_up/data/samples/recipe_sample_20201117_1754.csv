also a copycat of pappa roti.
these are delicious and so different- not really mexican, they are from malaysia.  it is like a thin coffee butter cookie spread over the bun. when you bite into these the outside is crisp while the inside is soft and buttery.  

i have been told you can freeze the cooked buns and heat in an oven for 10-12 min.(never tried this)--the texture does end up being more chewy/dense after the first day (still tastes good)--so i halve the recipe if i know they won't get eaten by the next morning. or refrigerate half the dough to use the next day.

the outer crust will go soft after a while--if the buns are room temperature, heat in oven for about 4-5 minutes and then take out and wait a minute or two and it crisps up again.

you may need extra bread flour in the final dough when kneading if too sticky...add a tbs at a time.  this recipe is converted from metric to us measurements so it is not always easy to get exact.","coffee cookie buns  aka mexican coffee buns  rotiboy  copycat course, main-ingredient, cuisine, preparation, for-large-groups, breads, snacks, eggs-dairy, asian, oven, eggs, stove-top, yeast, equipment, number-of-servings, baking, from-scratch water, bread flour, instant yeast, caster sugar, warm water, salt, unsalted butter, vital wheat gluten, eggs, ice cubes, liquid honey, powdered milk, salted butter, icing sugar, instant coffee, hot water, all-purpose flour",2011-08-26

my thanks to baby kato for the basic recipe that survived all my tweaks & still produced an excellent cake! the texture is light & the cake is very moist. i made 1/2 the recipe last night & ate some warm from the oven.it was marvelous but the true test of a low fat cake is will it ""still love me tomorrow"" ;-)  i had some for breakfast & it was still just as good with none of that strange texture that often accompanies low fat baked goods. you would never guess that it's low fat!
note: baking time for 1/2 recipe (8x8 pan) was 32 minutes.","lower fat easy banana cake time-to-make, course, main-ingredient, preparation, desserts, fruit, cakes, tropical-fruit, bananas, 4-hours-or-less nonfat milk, lemon juice, light butter, sugar, low-fat sour cream, splenda granular, egg beaters egg substitute, bananas, vanilla, butter flavor extract, flour, whole wheat pastry flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda",2007-01-08
