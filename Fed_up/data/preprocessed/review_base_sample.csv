278406,386585,5,1,"This is a great variation on the classic Reuben sandwich.  Instead of the tartness of sauerkraut, the sweet and tangy cole slaw mixture was a nice change.  It is also really easy to make, and I will definitely be having this again (and without the guilt of a regular Reuben)!  Thanks for posting, 2Bleu.  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game.",2008-09-29
278406,27443,5,1,"If you like Reubens this is a must to try!  I can not say enough about this sandwich. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. I made it as an open face, thus eliminating the calories etc of 1 slice of bread. Thanks for sharing your revision.",2008-01-15
278406,803511,5,1,"Great Reuben variation!  I liked making the coleslaw/sauerkraut myself.  I added an extra handful of cabbage into the pot because it was cooking down so much it didn't look like enough for two sandwiches.  When I put the sandwiches together I only ended up using about 2/3 of the meat and 1/2 the cheese called for.  I shredded cheese off a block instead of using slices.  Lastly, I just can't give up my usual Reuben sauce (mayo, chili sauce, horseradish) so we subbed that for the mayo/mustard suggested in your recipe.  I think overall using less cheese and meat brought this ""lighter"" Reuben down even farther!  Made for PRMR Tag Game.",2009-06-26
92154,149342,3,0,Cook time on the broiling is a little long-- the ends of the legs got slightly burned.  Also a little more Old Bay seasoning (2Tbs) is a little tastier.  ,2004-07-05
92154,223979,5,1,Very good!  I love soft shell crabs and always have them in the freezer.  I followed the other reviewers advice about the Old Bay seasoning.  I added a tablespoon to the flour.  They turned out great!  Thanks!,2009-01-12
194799,197788,4,1,This was tasty! I left out the zucchini as we don't like it. The only problem I had was I didn't have a lid for my cast iron skillet so I just put tinfoil over it.,2007-06-13
278617,62264,5,1,Wonderful recipe! Cut 2 whole breasts from a bird into strips & proceded as directed. Doubled sauce & added about a teaspoon of fennel seed. Got pulled away from stove so added a cup of chardonnay & let simmer after step 7. Added 1/2 cup fresh chopped Italian parsley a couple of minutes before plating. Served as suggested with rigatoni. Otstanding piquant gently tempered by the balsamic vinegar. I can't wait to make with garden fresh tomatoes & basil w/o interruption this summer. Thank you Alotizzi for a real keeper!,2008-05-15
229794,428885,5,1,"Made this for lunch, and let me tell you, if I could, I could eat this everyday. Happened to have chutney that needed using up, and had everything else on hand too. The bacon and shaved smoked salmon  coupled with the onion and cream cheese and chives just make an absolute terrific sandwich! I can see that you can also serve this on toast points and maybe the addition of cucumber too. Thanks so much English Rose! ZWT3 07'",2007-06-04
229794,128473,5,1,What a great sandwich.  I adored all the flavors and textures in this treat.  The mango chutney was a real nice addition.  I will be making these again often.  Thanks for sharing :),2010-05-03

106241,49304,5,1,"Very good,I made 2 large onions made them just like the recipe stated. We really enjoyed them with Swordfish and a big salad. We love the syrupie balsamic sauce over the onion. Thank you Mermaidmagic, for the recipe.",2005-01-17

232088,136997,5,1,"Interesting cookie. Very crisp, which I don't mind. I was only able to use 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips and I assumed the directions meant 6 cups of whole potato chips before crushing. I used Ms Vickie's, which are my favorite. :)",2009-06-17
232088,831774,5,1,"These cookies intrigue me. First of all i added about 8 ounces of crushed ruffle chips.. and 4 ounces semi sweet choc chips.  When i first tasted the dough, i didnt think i liked the nutmeg. I used a cookie scoop and baked them without switching for 12 minutes (perfect) and as said they turn out very thin and flat. But this turned out to make them crisp on the outside and soft and REALLY good in the middle. And after they were baked i found that i do like the nutmeg, although i would like to try it without out. It gives them almost a bit of a toffee hint in them ? however weird this was this recipe turned out to be VERY goood !",2010-05-15
232088,2198343,4,1,Interesting recipe. We made the mistake of making these way too big. We&#039;ll know to scoop less batter next time!  We also used less chocolate chips that the recipe called for.  We thought they were too many.,2014-12-03
87861,198754,5,1,"I love Greek food, but I had never made it at home, so I went on a search for good, well written recipes that were thorough.  This one definitely measured up.  

Lamb is strong tasting, but this recipe has a lot of ""zingy"" ingredients that seem to tame the lamb and make it incredibly flavorful. I used a little extra lemon, so I added breadcrumbs from one slice of bread to help bind the meat mixture.
 
I also blended the ground lamb with all the ingredients in a food processor before putting it on the skewers.  It gave it a more ""pressed"" texture like gyros look on spits in Greek restaurants. 

Since you can't sample raw meat to make sure you've gotten enough salt and spices; I saut√©ed a small meatball to taste before grilling.  

I prepared the suggested tzatziki sauce (80959) which was thick and yummy, and also made baked Greek (garlic) lemon potatoes (451) which were fantastic!  I also highly recommend using recipe (59898) for Greek-style salad dressing.  It has traditional ingredients, plus feta and buttermilk.  My kitchen was a complete mess, but the entire meal was delicious!

87861,62562,4,1,"The flavors in this dish are exquisite! We loved it 5 stars for flavor and enjoyment! Even my 2 & 4yo grandsons devoured them. I only gave 4 stars because I had to add about a cup of breadcrumbs for binder to get them to hold together well enough to grill. And even then they barely hung on until they were cooked enough not to fall through the grill. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written. 
Next time I make these (and there will be a next time) I will add the bread crumbs and just form elongated patties. The meat didn't want to stay on the skewers anyway, it was just too soft of a mixture.
We used all the suggested toppings and I highly recommenmd the za'atar. Thanks Lorie for a very delicious meal!!!",2008-03-29
355,623266,5,1,"This is my husband's favorite apple crisp recipe.  He doesn't like apple crisp made with oats so I thought this was perfect ... and he agreed!  I omit the salt if I use salted butter.  Also, it takes approximately 8-10 apples to fill a 9 x 13 dish.",2008-02-14
355,4796,5,1,I was looking for a recipe to use up some of these apples someone gave me and I came upon this recipe - I was a little skeptical (sounded too easy to be good) - IT WAS TERRIFIC! Thanks!,2002-10-10

219720,284897,5,1,"Such a wondeful and easy addition to add when roasting chicken. I found that the chicken seemed a little more succulent and tender. The chicken had a fantastic light Lemoney taste through it.
For just a few extra minutes work  beforehand, you get such a wonderful and great tasting roast chicken. Who would of thought something so easy could make such a difference!!
Great recipe **Jubes**. This is my new way of roasting chicken!!! Thanks.",2007-11-04
219720,65502,5,1,This is very tasty! I made as directed except that I BBQ'd this on the rotisserie. I really liked the simplicity and moistness of this. I had this with mixed veggies and Recipe #263392. Very very good! Made for the No-Nonsense Nibblers for ZWT6. Thanks ***Jubes***! :),2010-06-19

34903,463202,4,1,"We really enjoyed this!  I loved having a good tasting curry that was cooked in the oven (no curry yellow to clean off of the stove).  This was easy to prepare and had a nice balance of flavors.  DH asked me to keep the recipe for the sauce.  I wish I could give this 5 stars, but picky picky DD didn't like it, and it is listed as a kid-pleaser.  The adults all thought it was great!",2007-04-24
470895,653438,5,1,This is such a rich and delicious dish...next time I might try using half-n-half but I made as instructed.  Sent DH out to grill the chicken while I made this and a green salad.  I love this dish.  Thank you for posting this recipe and it is going into my Favorites of 2012.  Made for Fall PAC 2012.,2012-11-06
201699,222055,4,1,These are really good. I really loved the crunch! I took pics but they didn't turn out. Thank you for the different type of peanut butter balls. They were very much worth the try!,2007-03-05

Your photos helped the process. Thank you for your time and effort on this endeavor. YUM!",2008-08-03
316804,415934,2,0,"This didn't work for me.  I was pretty disappointed in this recipe.  The rolls didn't rise well so they were pretty dense.  I felt like they needed a little more salt.

I followed the recipe exactly so I didn't use a greased pan (though I had a little inner argument about whether or not I should since I'm not a complete baking newbie) -- needless to say, half of each roll had to be soaked off the baking sheet.",2008-08-25
46448,35526,5,1,"I had to peel the shrimp to get the veins out, lol.  I used 3 tablespoons of garlic.  Great flavor but bad breath.  I only cooked about 20 minutes because my shrimps were not hugh and the shells were off.  ",2003-03-14
46448,1206102,5,1,"Almost identical to one I use all the time!  I use the large shrimp, however.  How right you are about the messy aspect---I NEVER serve this one anywhere but our OUTDOOR dining table, with a roll of paper towels at either end of the table!  You're right about the bread to ""sop up"" those delicious juices.  And we love fresh boiled corn to go along with the shrimp.  MMM!",2009-10-18
30799,86520,3,0,I made this with semi-sweet chocolate chips and walnuts. I halved the recipe. I used pure choc. chips but I found the finished product rather bitter. I also used unsalted nuts. Maybe with salted nuts and milk chocolate chips I would have found this tastier. ,2004-01-06
220946,205555,5,1,A wonderful change from regular and garlic smashed potatos. This is a rich but fresh tasting dish. The basil and parmesan added both fresh and sharp flavor notes. Everyone liked this so much that this is going to be the 'new' comfort dish around here. A 'keeper' recipe!,2007-04-08
220946,8688,5,1,"Sharon, these potatoes are wonderful!  So easy to do in the oven.  The roasting of the red potatoes seems to give this recipes lots of added flavor!  I will enjoy preparing this again!  Thanks, Sharon : )",2007-04-10
220946,111291,5,1,"YUMMMMM .... these are absolutely delicious!!  If there were 6 stars, I'd rate it that!  Simple to make but taste gourmet, like you've spent a long time in the kitchen. I'm not a huge garlic fan, so I cut down on the amount a bit, but still awesome!!  Thanks for a keeper recipe!",2007-04-22
220946,384041,5,1,"Absolutely delicious!

I had the first pinchings from my basil crop to use. Mmmmm.

The only thing I'll do differently next time will be to double the parmensan.

This made a great side for a family meal, but I wouldn't hestitate to put it in front of even the most special guests.",2007-05-18
220946,141293,5,1,"Wonderful potatoes.  Not as creamy as some mashed, but with loads of flavor.  Excellent with Recipe #89251 and sliced tomatoes with blue cheese.",2007-08-23
220946,227024,5,1,"Used a whole bag of baby red potatoes for this one, (which I think was 2 lbs.???)  Didn't change anything else though, and they came out perfectly!

220946,47559,5,1,"I didn't have the fresh basil, so I made these without it.  They were delicious and DS asked me to make them again just like the first batch.  One of these days I want to try it with the basil!  Great recipe.",2009-02-03
220946,139475,5,1,"Was wary about the roasting method at first for some reason, but it added a depth that boiled smashed potatoes just don't have!  Yummy. Yummy.

220946,175492,5,1,"Ohhhhh darn it anyway, I want to give this recipe at least 10 stars!  I made this with the last of the red potatoes harvested from my garden, I didn't have any fresh basil so used 1 TBLS dried basil instead, otherwise made exactly per the recipe.  These are so doggone good, and they barely made it to the table before they were gone.  This from a household that would rather eat pasta or rice, quite the compliment.  Will make these often and am saving it to my Sides Cookbook.  Made for KK's Chefs Pick Event.",2010-02-09

220946,560491,4,1,"Good potatoes!  I like that they are baked and not boiled, gives them that fluffy texture you get with baked potatoes.  The basil gives it a nice fresh taste and the amount of butter and parmesan cheese was perfect.  Made for Zaar Stars.",2012-05-22
220946,136828,5,1,"These are great potatoes!!  I used yukon golds, since that's what I had on hand, and black truffle butter in place of regular butter.  I thought that the amount of basil might be overwhelming, but it really went well in the dish.  Plus, this recipe is so easy to put together, it would be perfect for a dinner party.

325808,498376,3,0,"In the future, I would use less onion or possibly exclude the onion.  Although only a small amount of onion, the taste overwhelmed the entire salad!  The salad also needs more salt.  Finally, I would add garlic or mayo to add some 'zing'.",2009-07-05
86501,507337,5,1,"HEAVENLY! 
Also GREAT with banana! Has an almost banana foster like flavor.
I did this with one tortilla, and half the ingredients. Instead of buttering the tortilla I just cooked it over the butter and sugar on low heat in a nice stick free pan. Was easier, and tasted better in my opinion.",2007-06-02
86501,45057,5,1,My boys ate this up.  I did use bananas though. It tasted just like a bananas foster quesadilla. It was really good.,2008-01-05
254565,199848,5,1,"Fabulous!  This goes on the ""comfort food"" list.  I used the option of the chopped onion instead of the powder.  I did cut some fat;  I used reduced-fat smoked sausage, and my milk and half and half were fat free and the soup was still thick and creamy.  I used 4 oz of cheddar in place of Velveeta.  I love sauerkrautr, so I used a whole 15-oz can.  This has such great flavor.  It's now one of my favorite soups!  I'm tempted to add some potatoes... maybe carrots, too, for a hearty meal-in-one soup!   Thanx for this recipe!!!",2008-01-24

My tips:  don't bother using the knife to cut up the peaches; when you dump them in the cake mix and beat w/ a mixer, they break up nicely.  I also covered the cake w/ foil for the latter half of baking b/c it was getting a bit too brown.
Served this w/ mixed berry sauce and whipped cream.  Yum.",2005-07-12

376097,2957166,0,0,Great way to use up this year&#039;s bumper crop of figs. I modified the recipe to make a true skillet cake (as all good upsidedown cakes should be made!). It unmolded perfectly and looked beautiful.,2013-08-24
376097,12041592,5,1,"I have a very productive brown turkey fig tree and have made a couple of batches of fig infused vodka, which were delicious.  But, I had quite a few vodka soaked figs left over and didn&#039;t want to waste them.  So, I followed this recipe exactly, but also chopped and folded the slightly drunken figs into the batter.  The cake was fantastic and the added figs made it very moist and gave it an extra flavor punch.  I served it to a guest last night and had to freeze what was left so I wouldn&#039;t eat the rest of it today myself!",2014-09-07

408628,568934,5,1,Oh My Heavens!!!  I had to make a few minor adjustments like a jar of diced tomatoes as I forgot this at the store and used carmelized onions as shallots looked horrible at the store.  I also used pepper bacon from the amish market and Asiago instead of the cheddar.  This was the first time I had avocado in a sandwich and it will not be my last.  Even Hubby loved this.

266220,1012048,2,0,Not bad.  They didn't hold together real well and maybe if the turkey had been finely shredded they would have or perhaps add another egg.  I didn't use soup over them either.,2010-11-26

266220,50969,5,1,"I made these on 11/28/11,using leftovers from our Thanksgiving Dinner (which we had on 11/27/11). I followed the recipe as it was written but after chilling, I did have to add about 1/4 cup of unseasoned bread crumbs to make it firm enough to form the croquettes. To save a step, I combined the flour with the bread crumbs and then rolled croquettes in that and fried. I made homemade gravy by melting a little margarine and added some finely chopped onion,cooked until onion was soft.Then I added about 3 tablespoons of of flour and cooked long enough to get rid of the flour taste.And added about 1 cup of chicken broth and stirred until slightly thickened,and seasoned with S & P.I served the gravy over the croquettes and mashed potatoes,along with peas and carrots on the side. I know they were made too big,because I ended up with 6 instead of 8. But the next time ( and there sure will be a nest time :) ), I'll try to make them smaller.

I think I could have baked them a little longer, I thought the whites were done but discovered in some of the ""cracks"" they were not cooked.  I cooked four in a pie plate and I believe they would have been better done separately in bowls as instructed.  Thanks for posting.",2007-11-26

Under griller for additional 5 - 8 minutes this plate did see! I also like yolks hard, hubby soft too! So cracked yolk on mine when it started to settle too! Think 3 tomatoes could have been two, Also done with say 100 grams of feta, but maybe is personal taste, TRUE! I did make them in bowls separately, Was wondering if I put them in Pyrex casserole this next time...we'll see! THANKS!
Hubby also added splash of worchester sauce too! :)",2008-05-16

267160,169430,4,1,This is a nice change from the usual creamed peas. The timing in the recipe is right on and the veggies were well cooked at 10 mins. I left out any sweetening simply because I don't personally favor a sweetening in such things and I used chives in place of the parsley. I used fat free evap milk. The lemon pepper is a lovely touch.

62433,13796,5,1,This is the easiest and best tasting trifle ever! Since blueberries are not in season here and are still a little expensive I decided to make a strawberry/banana trifle. This is to die for and makes a beautiful presentation. Take heed... this is VERY RICH. Make sure you press the cake down a little with your hands because the trifle bowl will really fill up quickly. ,2003-05-18

This was such a hit and I am glad that I made (10) copies of the recipe and gave out all ten and a couple more had to write it down!!!!!
The next time I made this, I amde with the blueberries and it was phenominal.  However, I made it with fat free cream cheese, lite cool whip and fat free sweetened condensed milk (in a greenish can)and I couldn't tell the difference nor could anyone else!!! It helps to cut down on any calories/fat that we can, so we can eat more of it!! It is very rich, but it didn't stop anyone from over eating it!  Thanks NurseDi",2003-07-14
62433,40620,4,1,"This was a really good quick trifle. The angel food cake and the vanilla mixture were nice with the blueberries for a cool dessert in the hot summer. I only gave it four stars for two reasons. One, the vanilla cream mixture is very thick, I had to stir the whipped cream in and it was still so thick I couldn't spread it over the angel food cake pieces without taking most of the cake along with it. It was also a little too heavy for the lightness of the cake itself. Making it again... I would add enough whipped cream to make it spreadable. Definately more than 1 1/2 cups. ",2003-07-23

I beat it with an electric hand mixer.  It took quite a while - 6 or more minutes- to reach a soft peak satge and it never progressed further than that.  In fact, after adding the honey and vanilla , it never made it back to soft peaks.  And I beat it an additional 6 minutes before giving up.  So I served it as a side sauce.  What can I say?  It tasted like sweetened condensed milk which had been sweetened.  Didn't taste good, didn't look appealing.",2013-03-08

Here is one modification I made:  I added 2 Tbsp. of sugar to sweeten and added the vanilla to the milk before chilling it. I added the sugar by sprinkling it over while whipping this. This resulted in a just sweet topping that helps offset any underlying sweetness in the dessert. Great on homemade strawberry shortcakes.",2013-04-22

I added a little garlic and also used some chipotle powder in the sauce that I had to spice it up a little, but stayed true to the recipe other than that.  I usually use corn tortillas with my enchiladas, but this was very good and easy for a quick meal.  Thanks! :)",2005-06-19
17586,195969,5,1,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!! This has become a top 5 in our house!! I make double and freeze some too. I used homemade sauce (Enchilada Sauce  #31811.) Thanks!!!",2005-06-19
17586,101823,4,1,"I added cumin, minced garlic, chili powder, salt and pepper to my ground beef as I was browning it.  I also stirred some black bean and corn salsa into the beef and onion mixture instead of the enchilada sauce.  I poured part of the enchilada sauce into the bottom of my baking dish and rolled the meat mixture up in corn tortillas.  This was topped with more sauce and a shredded colby/monterey jack cheese.  It was an excellent quick and easy dinner that we topped with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, onions, sour cream, guacamole and more salsa. ",2005-08-13
17586,150727,5,1,"Awesome, easy and inexpensive recipe.  We loved this!! I did add chopped green chilis in with the filling, cause we like them in mexican.  I would recommend this for company.  I also had sour cream on the side. Thanks for the recipe.",2005-09-12

I followed the recipe except I added garlic to the meat, and I also threw some of a frozen blend of onions and green, yellow and red peppers that I happened to have in the freezer. I served it with sour cream and fiesta rice on the side and we scarfed it up like there was no tomorrow. lol The canned sauce was a little too spicy for the kids though, so i will definately make my own next time. Thanks for sharing! This will be a regular in our house!

17586,97950,4,1,easy to make and tastey too!  Used mild enchilada sauce and put 1 1/2 cups of cheese in the meat mixture to make it thicker.  Kids and DH loved it!  me too cause dinner was on the table fast!,2006-09-10

In order to use what I had in the house, I used a green sauce (salsa verde) and a combo of cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.  I had the ground beef pre-browned with onions in my freezer, so I just warmed it up in the microwave before stirring in the cheese and sauce.  These went together very quickly, and the resulting meal was great.  I served this with recipe # 154918 and cheesy rice.  I'll be making these again- thanks for sharing!",2006-10-31

I also used red fat monterery jack cheese. If you're a picky person like me, use about 1/3 cup of the meat to fill each tortilla. I also heated the remaining enchilada sauce & cheese in a saucepan before pouring over the tortillas. Oh, yes & I also used whole wheat tortillas. Came out FANTASTIC!",2006-11-15
17586,177933,5,1,"Couldn't be easier and tasted great!  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I used 8 large corn tortillas, I dipped them into the enchilada sauce to soften them and then filled-em and rolled-em up.  I know I used more than 2 cups of cheese, but I didn't measure.  We topped them with lite sour cream and habanero sauce.  Thanks!",2006-11-15

17586,142559,5,1,"YUM! I added a little more onion (DH's preference) to the ground beef and when I mixed in the cheese and sauce with the meat, I added 1 small can of sliced olives (again, DH's preference!). I accidentally grabbed green sauce at the store instead of red, but these still turned out fantastic! This is my new keeper recipe for enchiladas! Thanks!!",2006-12-09

This really IS the easiest beef enchiladas recipe ever! 

I even re-heated it for lunch today and even though it didn't LOOK as good as it did last night...it may have tasted even better!  

I made mine with ground turkey and lowfat cheese.  

THANKS AS USUAL!",2007-07-17
17586,407007,5,1,"wow! this was so easy AND do delicious. I finally, after four years of trying, got my man to eat enchiladas. :) I read to him the list of ingredients and he realized there was nothing to hate about these! I had never had enchilada sauce before... and was unaware it has some spice to it. I spiced up the meat in the pan with some chili powder, garlic, seasoning salt, and pepper, and found myself wishing I hadn't spiced the meat at all, as they came out a little too spicy for my hubby & I. so there you go, your recipe is PERFECTION and I shouldn't have messed with perfection! thanks for a keeper!!",2007-07-22
17586,292507,5,1,"This was very good and very easy, I only baked it for 25 minutes because the sauce and the cheese were starting to burn. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef because it is lower in fat but taste just the same. Will make again!!",2007-07-26
17586,357323,5,1,"This was really good! I used low carb tortillas, that was the only mistake. The parts that were under the sauce came out doughy. Next time I'll make this with normal tortillas, the taste is worth the extra carbs!
I'll make this again, and soon!",2007-07-29
17586,187281,3,0,We liked this recpe but didn't love it.  The upside to this dish is that it cooks a little longer and the cheese gets a nice crispy texture that compliments the softness of the tortillas.  The downside is that the tortillas tasted a bit soggy and rubbery to us and they stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I followed the directions exactly so I am not sure what caused it.  The filling is good and something I would recreate but next time I will grease the pan with butter first and put no more than 1-2 tbsp of sauce over each one and then the cheese.  The flavor was a bit spicy and cheesy which was nice.,2007-08-10
17586,389431,5,1,"These were so simple to make and very yummy!  My husband doesn't like corn tortillas so finding a good recipe that uses flour tortillas was fabulous!

This was my first crack at making enchiladas and my family enjoyed them, including my step-daughter. I used recipe #109685, which was equally wonderful.

I changed just a few things, I took the suggestion of Cindytc and used 1 cup sour cream instead of ff enchilada sauce for the filling and added a can of green chilies.

17586,714956,5,1,"yum! I used the rosarita enchilada sauce which is the best I have tasted from a can. I also doubled the ground beef since the package I had was 2 lbs. I am lazy so I just layered it like a lasagne, nice and easy. I also added a small can of el pato (yellow can) to the meat for a little bit of spice. this turned out perfect and it was so easy I will make over and over again. I topped it off with olives and served it with sour cream. thank you for sharing this recipe!!! :)",2008-08-27
17586,674022,5,1,"Thank you MizzNezz for this recipe! I made this recipe and it was quickly gone! Yum. It was super easy. The only thing I did differently was that I added 1/8 teaspoon seasoning salt to the meat, changed the onion to red onion and added 4.25oz of chopped black olives to the top....(thanks to jenn 2500 for the olive idea) Also I used half corn and half flour tortillas as that is what I had leftover. They both came out ok but the flour stays together easier. My family really enjoyed these after soccer practice and I was glad to have a quick meal that wasn't sandwiches! We will make again and again. Thanks. ChefDLH",2008-09-09

I added some garlic powder and cumin after mixing in the sauces. I used the soft taco size tortialls and those worked very well for me.

17586,1510016,5,1,"First, I've got to admit that I screwed this up. I planned to make per recipe with the addition of some taco seasoning, using corn tortillas (can't eat gluten), and that's what I *thought* I did. Well, not so much. When it was done, we dug in and found that it had more heat than we thought it should, and a much smokier, fuller flavor. I figured it was the brand of enchilada sauce I used and decided to omit the taco seasoning next time. Well, I checked the can and found that it was Red Chile Sauce. Oops. No worries, though, it was still delicious. I kept my tortillas from breaking by using my fingers to spread a bit of water over them before briefly steaming both sides in a hot skillet. They were very pliable. I also spooned a couple tablespoons of the sauce in the bottom of my casserole dish to make sure the tortillas wouldn't stick. Cleanup was a breeze, no need to spray the dish with oil. With just 2 of us I divided the recipe into 2 8x8 casseroles and will freeze one. As easy as this is, I think it would be even easier done as a layered casserole. The corn tortillas held together but cut easily with a fork, as they should. Even with my major error, this is a very tasty dish, going into my monthly rotation. Really, I can hardly wait to make this with enchilada sauce!",2012-10-31

Over time, I have made some changes, or, I should probably say variations. I prepare the meat exactly as written, but I also take Zatarain&#039;s Spanish rice mix and prepare that, then add to the beef mixture. This practically doubles your filling. I end up making 2 pans of enchiladas which you&#039;d think would give me left overs, but it never does LOL. I use a Mexican cheese blend in place of cheddar, and I also add sliced black olives to the top of the cheese before baking it. YUM! Always served with sour cream.",2014-02-22

The only tweak I made was adding a clove of minced garlic along with the onion. I did add a small can of green chilis once because I had them on hand, but it‚Äôs just as good without them. I use Old Elpaso enchilada sauce and it is perfect in this recipe. I use pre-shredded Mexican cheese (the thick cut if you can find it) and it melts wonderfully. My husband said this is the best Mexican food he‚Äôs ever had and my daughter requests it often. So easy and SO yummy!!",2018-03-31

This doesn't have much ""sauce"", but you don't need it because the sesame oil and spices/seasonings that cook up with the veggies give you flavor in every bite.  I used the full 4 teaspoons of grated ginger because we love it and the rice vinegar as well.

I increased the garlic to six cloves, I added a teaspoon of fresh thyme and I used all of the portabello mushrooms - i.e. stems and gills - but otherwise made this exactly to the recipe.

Other than that--I followed the recipe as written.  I served it over Rossi's Wild Mushroom Pasta.  It was so yummy!  Even though there is cream in this sauce--it is not heavy.

UPDATED:  Since we are trying to reduce the amount of white flour we eat, I made these this morning with 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1/2 c rolled oats and 1 tsp cinnamon for some fantastically great whole-grain pancakes.  I loved the taste- hearty and slightly nutty, and I felt better about serving my family pancakes!  I did keep all other measurements and ingedients the same, except for souring my milk with vinegar.

Just as easy as a mix and so much tastier!  I used all whole wheat flour instead of the regular as I was out, and had to add about another 1/4 cup buttermilk as I thought the batter was too thick.

66241,443469,5,1,"I've been using this recipe for about 6 months now, and I thought it was high time I rated it.

This batter makes perfect, tender, fluffy, buttermilk pancakes.  (enough adjectives?)

A word on batter consistency:  I only mention this because I was worried about it the first time I used this recipe.  The batter is very thick.  I mean thick.  It was almost as thick as a muffin batter, but not quite.

Obviously it's easy enough to add some extra moisture, but after trying it ""as is"" I found that this thick consistency made for thicker, fluffier pancakes.

I also sometimes skip the vanilla extract if I don't have it, and find that the resulting pancakes are just as good.  

Great recipe!",2008-07-20

i like to use 2-3x the amount of suggested vanilla and substituted demerara brown sugar for white. the vanilla makes such a difference!
that said, the batter is a little thick and takes some getting used to, make sure to move it around the pan a little to thin it out, also, the edges do not bubble up (at least i found) like the average pancake so do watch the colouring! (the burnt one tasted good too though)  the recipe is absolutely marvellous.  THANKS SO MUCH!!

(1) When greasing the pan, remember to wipe up the excess. The pancakes will come out much more golden and delicious-looking. Also, don't forget to grease between each pancake.
(2) Keep an oven-safe plate in a 175-degree oven and keep all your pancakes in there until serving time.
(3) In everything I do that calls for vanilla, I double or triple the amount. Here, I only doubled.
(4) Try different spices in the batter. I added 1 tsp of nutmeg (it's the holiday season) and it was awesome - just an undertone of seasonal tastiness

66241,637765,4,1,"An easy recipe to follow and this helped me use up some buttermilk I had lingering in the fridge. It was a bit dense for my preference, but definitely thick (which I like in my pancakes). The density issue could be because one of my eggs ended up having two yolks (!!) and by the time I discovered that it was too complicated to fix the extra yolk out. Will definitely try again.",2011-05-12

I think we will be making these pancakes again.",2012-09-03
66241,1856659,5,1,"Me and my guy loved them! Had so much flavor for a pancake which can be so plain tasting. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla though, because I have a hard time only adding a tiny amout of vanilla to anything lol. But overall, GREAT pancake, very pleased :)",2012-09-08

66241,1488517,5,1,"One word: YUM. Rave reviews all around. Don't sub anything else for the butter, I think that has a lot to do with the deliciousness factor. Also, I wanted to mention that I spaced and forgot the sugar, and really, I don't think it's necessary. BF says not to use it, since they are fantastic as is. So if you're trying to watch your sugar intake, this is one small way to get rid of a little (granted, jam and syrup are going to have tons of sugar, but baby steps, right?). Again, these have great flavor, and I won't be looking any further for a pancake recipe, because this is the clear winner. I used spelt flour. Thanks for posting! :)",2012-10-29

66241,1801865125,2,0,"So disappointed! I really wanted this recipe to work, as my husband loves boxed pancake mix and I wanted to get away from it. I made the recipe as directed and I found the flavor to be much too salty, much too salty. I also had to shake the pan a bit to get the batter to thin out since my first few pancakes were too thick and were mushy in the middle. I will try this recipe again, cutting the salt in half and doubling up on the vanilla, maybe even use a bit less butter (I did not even need to &quot;grease&quot; my non-stick pan). I guess I should note that we do not add salt to our food normally, I do use kosher salt as a garnishing salt for flavor. Also, we try to eat without very much animal fat. That might be why we were not as happy, we we do not claim to be healthy eaters either, so I don&#039;t know. I&#039;ll update after I try my modifications.",2014-01-04

66241,2000420975,5,1,"I followed the recipe with the exception of using vanilla bean paste (1 tsp) since I was out of vanilla extract. I used a non stick pan with a 1/2 dollar size amount of canola oil per pancake  (helped to make crispy edges!) and made a total of 8 pancakes which where 6 inches in diameter and 3/8-1/2 inch thick. Cook time was about 4 minutes so took me about 30 min plus overall for cook time. I used a electric mixer to foam eggs and mix the wet ingredients. Then folded in dry indgredients until well mixed (but not over mix so batter looked somewhat lumpy and airy). Think foaming the eggs helped with the airy-ness of the pancake. Overall, tasty, fluffy, and easy to make.",2015-08-22

66241,2000457187,2,0,"To be honest, I chose this recipe because I only had two cups of buttermilk... For me, I felt like the recipe was a bit too heavy on the dry ingredients. Which I should have been aware of when choosing the recipe, but that was the risk I was to take. Because it&#039;s heavy on the dry ingredients, I got much more flour flavor instead of buttermilk. If I were to make this recipe again I think I&#039;ll try adding a bit more butter milk - maybe a half cup - and likely double on the sugar. There is enough dry ingredients that I don&#039;t think the added buttermilk would compromise the integrity of the butter and since the sugar is added with the wet ingredients, I don&#039;t think it will really affect the way the eggs work with the batter. I do like how well these fry though. They&#039;re really easy to turn and result in a nice crisp edge to them. If you like thick pancakes, this is the way to go. Overall, not bad but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be craving them anytime soon.",2015-09-06

I just made a half recipe and got a couple of salt pockets in the bubbles that formed when the buttermilk and soda reacted.  I didn&#039;t want to overmix the batter, and with a half batch it&#039;s a small amount of batter, so I&#039;m guessing it didn&#039;t mix completely with my hand mixer.

I had everything in hand already but the buttermilk, but found online i could make my own using milk and lemon juice (or can use vinegar).

Next time I'll probably try cayenne instead of Old Bay, and/or maybe a little cinnamon. Overall this is a very good recipe in my opinion.",2017-09-23

203549,68460,4,1,"This was really good.  I halved the recipe for just my husband and myself, left out the cayenne pepper because of my husband's stomach issues.  I also left out the salt because with 1/2 cup of soy sauce at the end of recipe I felt it didn't need any more sodium.  The black pepper in step two wasn't listed in the ingredients...I just did a few grounds over the fish to our taste.  I did lower the amount of soy sauce, 1/2 cup is way too much (I halved the recipe and 1/4 Cup is still too much, I used about 2 T. of the soy sauce).  The 'smoking oil' is a nice touch and I've done that before in similar recipes...it wilts the cilantro and adds great flavor, however, I used half sesame oil and half peanut oil....a little sesame oil goes a long, long way!  Thanks for the recipe Annacia!",2007-01-18

Once it started smoking, I poured it over the green onions and cilantro, which I had placed in a small bowl.  Then I topped the fish.  This wilted the green onions and cilantro, but left the fish alone.  I thought this was fabulous!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Photo Tag!",2011-03-05

324802,624665,5,1,"The 1st time I made this soup I only had 1/2 an onion and no bay leaf - it was good but not great as was a little bland. Easily remedied with red pepper flakes, tomatoes, &amp; nutritional yeast though! :) This time, I cooked *almost* exactly per recipe- used one huge yellow onion and the bay leaf - amazing the flavor difference. Much sweeter and tastier. I also used white pepper instead of black and a BIG dash of cayenne. Love how easy and yummy this soup is! Can&#039;t beat the fiber &amp; protein for the calories either. I like the thick consistency but could imagine adding more water to make an even bigger batch without losing much if any of the flavor. This time and last I put in Tupperware and stored in the freezer. Was ez to nuke from frozen and tasted just great (just needs to be stirred). The first time I did the low and long, the 2nd the short and hot - the short and hot made for a chunkier soup (some of the carrots and just a little bit of the onion stayed &#039;in tact&#039; whereas slow and long they pretty much dissolved into the soup- either way works for me so personal preference I guess) . And I still like putting red pepper and nutritional yeast on it but now it doesn&#039;t *need* it! Enjoy!",2013-03-18

I also used the Grands biscuits, a 16 oz package rather than the 10 oz size suggested in the recipe. When I rolled the biscuits, I used Wondra flour to keep them from sticking, which I think helped to thicken the broth.

Will definitely make again! Reviewed for Herb of the Month-July. Thank you!,2010-08-26

78892,2123645,4,1,"These muffins are delicious even though I did have some difficulty with the recipe. It says that it makes 12 muffins, but I got 16 muffins. It&#039;s important to not overfill the muffin cups, otherwise the topping will overflow into the oven and burn and smoke will come billowing out of the oven (not that I would know anything about this....) I also found that it worked better to bake the muffins at 350 instead of 375. The other thing is that I used only about half of the topping, so I recommend only making half of the topping for one batch of muffins. Otherwise, we loved these muffins! They are sweet and moist and the pie filling really intensifies the blueberry flavor. My husband took some to work to share with his coworkers and they were devoured.",2013-08-09

I had a neighbor that worked the deli and if they had Marcie Salad left she called and I got the 20 per cent off that she got for working there plus the discount since it could not be sold next day. I bet I ate there hundreds if times and 95 per cent of the time it was the salad I ordered. We use to have that than would go down to Sanders for the Ice Cream Puff...we were in heaven.

Now, gyoza is a japanese adaptation of the chinese Kao-Tien/Pekinese fried ""raviolis"". In Japan, they usually put some garlic or garlic leaves whereas in china they don't.
Heat your pan hot before frying your gyoza so that the bottom will be crispy and the top soft. Beef seems better suited for deep-fried gyoza since it gets dry at cooking.

262750,70073,5,1,"Delicious combination of apples, raisins, onion and celery in this stuffing. I used 8 thin boneless fast fry pork chops; placed the stuffing between two chops and tied them together with white kitchen string. I browned them lightly in a small amount of hot vegetable oil and placed them in an 8"" square baking dish, with a little homemade chicken broth in the bottom of the pan. Covered and baked them at 325 degrees Fahrenheit until the chops were done. I added a little more chicken broth about half way through cooking time too. Served the chops with roasted potatoes that were baked in the oven at the same time, and added buttered carrots, cole slaw, and recipe #80681 for dessert. I will definitely make this stuffing again for chicken breasts, turkey, or even thin steaks for a rouladen recipe.",2009-11-30

One...it is hard to get sage all the same size, so I would separate into size before cooking.  Two: make sure that they are cooked enough or they will taste greasy.  These were really good, but I wouldn't use them as an appitizer, but as a garnish (like parsley) on a plate.  You will enjoy one or two, but not 50 of them!!!

I worry they will not like them! *laugh* So, this Christmas, I made them and they are sitting on the table in there waiting to go. I put two strips of nori over them and cut them in half. My son liked it, and I must say they were absolutely wonderful! Just like I remember. I did forget to buy furikake, but they were still amazing. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

107498,137302,5,1,"I am giving this recipe 5 stars for ease of preparation and for flavor.  I am wondering if people had not made it before because of the large amount of meat listed in the recipe.  I used only 3 lbs. of skinned legs & thighs but left the sauce ingredients in the same quantities because I wanted lots of sauce to use over mashed potatoes instead of the pasta.  The flavor was positively heavenly.  No one would ever guess that the main ingredients were prepared cream soups which some nay-sayers criticize so adamently.  I made one addition...I added 1 teaspoon of black pepper because I was afraid that it would be too bland for my family and they loved it.  My DS said, ""This is really good, but it would be better if the chicken were boneless"".  I agree completely and will make it with boneless thighs or breasts in the future.  This is a keeper.  BTW I added about 1/2 cup of water to the sauce to make a smoother sauce to top on the potatoes.  (I had about a quart of sauce in the saucepan.)  Every bite was sublime!  I highly recommend this recipe!  It would make a wonderful company dish or for a potluck. ",2005-03-24

107498,17803,5,1,"Totally awesome!  The bacon flavor permeated through all the pieces of chicken and the sauce.  I will be making this over and over again.  I used 3 hindquarters and 3 breasts to equal 5-6 pounds of chicken when I made mine.  After this had baked for 45 minutes I poured the grease off by placing a cooling rack over the meat and pan then tipped it up to the side so the grease ran off.  It worked really great, the chicken and bacon stayed in place in the baking dish!  The amount of sauce was just fine, I did add 1/3 cup of milk when I mixed it together.  I will remove the skin next time I make this and the bone-in is fine by me. This would be an excellent dish to serve your dinner guest but I would use skinless boneless chicken breast for them.

It was done in about 45 minutes (which inludes boiling the chicken and veggies in water which then made broth). Tasted best after sitting a while to let the flavors meld (probably would not have needed to let it rest if I had used the crockpot). Very good topped with grated parmesan cheese! Also added a small dash dry white wine (would be good too with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice). Next time I will try subbing frozen peas for the corn.

115253,136511,5,1,Let me start off by saying the changes I made: I used a half of a frozen turkey breast I had in the freezer leftover from when my mom roasted a turkey breast awhile back instead of the chicken.  I used frozen mixed vegetables in place of all of the vegetables listed and I used skim milk instead of the half and half and I added less than a half of a block of cream cheese.  I also cooked this stove top as opposed to crockpot and it took roughly 45 minutes...I didn't really count the time.  I served this with cornbread and it was a huge hit. It tasted just like the middle of a pot pie..it was thick and creamy and delicious and very filling.  I will definitely be making this again and again this winter. I dont know if this recipe actually serves 8 as it served me and my mom two hearty bowls each and a small bowl for my grandma but I guess it could?  I don't see it happening at my house though!  :),2007-11-17

I used Tyson Grilled Chicken Breast Strips, left out the onion, celery and carrots and instead used onion powder and 2 cups of frozen peas and carrots. I thought I had 2 cans of cream of potato soup but only had one so I used one can of Cheddar Cheese and one can of Cream of Potato.  I had an extra potato that was going to go bad so I diced it up without peeling it and threw that in. I forgot dill, so didn't use that either... Because I wasn't using onion and was using pre-cooked chicken, I didn't saut√É¬© anything; I just threw all the ingredients (except the half and half) into the crockpot and cooked it on low for 8 hours.

I ususally don't take liberties with a recipe the first time I make it but after reading your instructions and the rave reviews of others I figured that this is a versatile soup and could use whatever ingredients I had on hand.  For example, I used leftover cooked turkey and sauted the onions, celelry and carrots to further the cooking process (as you suggested).  I added cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups (that's what was in the cupboard), put in about 1 cup of leftover mashed potatoes, and threw in a handful of frozen peas.  Then I cooked it in the crockpot on low for 4 hours.  Wonderful!!  This will be a recipe that is made often at our house!  Thanks Roxygirl in Colorado!!",2009-04-14

I placed two raw boneless chicken breasts on top, then mixed the soups (cream of potato and chicken, plus broth) and poured over all.

I baked mine in a 22 cm round springform pan, and followed the directions exactly, except that I went a bit heavy on the vanilla and light on the sugar - personal taste only.

This is my first experience with a sponge cake as well (I think maybe even my first experience eating one as well as making one) and with the exception of a complete disaster with my frosting attempt (ended up glazing it with a loganberry glaze) it was a very good one.  The cake is light and spongey, very delecate.  I, like WaterMelon, baked it in an 8""x8"" pan with no problem at all.  It's a lovely little golden cake and its amazing how rich it tastes considering its only got a couple eggs, lowfat (I used 2% rather than skim) milk and a tsp of butter!  It was also very easy (I like anything that doesn't require me to cream or melt a ton of butter) and I will definitely be making this again.

I did not have whole cumin seeds, so I used ground cumin instead and I left out the beans, since my family doesn't care for beans in chili.

343272,169430,5,1,"WOW, I'm truly torn on how to rate this. First. the cookies are delicious. I baked for 6 1/2 mins, at which time they were a perfect soft golden color around the edges. They are soft centered and very ""toothsome"" and keep calling you back for another. I'm more than satisfied with the end result however I did have problems with the dough being to soft. I kept the dough in the fridge for 24 hrs, set up the work place and had everything ready before removing it from the fridge. I cut a piece of dough from the chilled ball and roller it at once using a marble rolling pin on a smooth ceramic tile surface. It rolled beautifully but it was still to soft for the cut outs to be lifted from the tile. They tore and couldn't hold the heart shape that I had cut them into. I ended up hand rolling pieces onto balls and rolling them in sugar. I flattened the sugared balls once on the baking sheet. I did add a pinch of vanillin but I can't imagine that that would cause the problem. I would make these again because they are so good but I will just plan to make them as round cookies.*EDIT*: I know why the dough didn't remain firm enough to work with, I used a non-hyrodgenated margarine instead of real butter!

81339,6357,4,1,"I made this for dinner tonight and served it with fat-free plain yogurt.   The onions were simply fantastic and instead of topping them on the cooked rice-lentil mixture, I mixed them into the same after removing from heat. That way everyone got to have the amazing onions instead of my brother simply gobbling them all up;) LOL. As for the dried lentils, I used yellow lentils{yellow moong dal}. I think it would be nice for others who want to try this recipe, if the recipe poster could mention which lentils to use for this recipe{you know, there are red, yellow, black, green and brown lentils and one  might get confused, or maybe you could just mention that it is upto the person trying the recipe to use his/her choice of lentils!}. I did not have olive oil on hand, so I substituted it with Pure Wesson Canola oil. As for the cumin seeds, I used 2 tsps. which I felt was just about perfect. It would be nice if one could mention how much black pepper to use for this. I took a guess and used 20 whole black peppercorns{unfortunately, since I do not have a grinder, I could not turn these into powder and had to use them whole only}. But, I definitely felt that this dish would taste much better if it was more spicy. Next time, I will be using some red chilli powder as well. What was worth admiring was how beautiful this looked when I lifted the lid off after cooking it for 25 minutes on simmer. It was so eye-catching that I wanted to grab my camera and click a pic! I did soak the lentils for about 30 minutes and the rice as well for the same amount of time. I did boil the lentils in 2 changes of water and threw off the scum both the times. That way I knew for sure that the lentils are cooked before adding them to the pot in which I was cooking this dish. The MOST IMPORTANT thing that I want to share about this is that the dish was very starchy{because the rice was cooked in the 3 cups of water and the water was not drained}.     Hence, next time onwards, I will be making this in a slightly different manner. I will be cooking the rice separately in 3 cups of SALTED boiling water until all the water has been absorbed by the rice{this is the starch-filled rice}. Now, I would put this cooked rice in a rice strainer and put it under a cold water tap. I would stir it with a spoon and let the starch get washed away COMPLETELY. Then, I will put the rice on a large plate and cook it in the microwave for 5-10 minutes. Once this is done, I know my rice is ready. Also, I will cook the lentils the same way I did today - i.e., in 2 changes of boiling water and then drain the water and scum, once the lentils are thoroughly cooked. Then, I would add the cooked rice and lentils to the cumin seeds and black peppercorns that I'd have crackled in hot oil in a pot.            Next, I would garnish it with the crispy fried onions and serve! This way I will be eating it guilt-free and STARCH-FREE! I'm sure this way I could go on eating it forever:) Thanks for posting! ",2004-06-05
81339,204150,5,1,"Excellent!  I made it with red lentils and basmati rice (because I didn't have any jasmine rice on hand.)  I used about 2 tsps of ground cumin.

I didn't soak anything but after adding the water I let it simmer on high heat for about 3 minutes before covering and turning down the heat.  

The warning about eating the onions before the rest is done is to be taken seriously... not only did I have to exercise self control but I had to fend off my husband as well who smelled them cooking and came a-foraging.  The combined flavour is worth the wait!!!!

I will make this again... next time I may try adding some chopped celery and carrots with the rice and lentils to make a more complete one-dish meal.  I'll probably add another onion too, to make up for ""shrinkage"" (the retail word for things disappearing...)

Also, I used whole pepper corns, about a tsp of them. The taste was great, but next time I will grind them so that the heat is more even. My carnivore DH even liked this, and my 1 year old loved it! The rice and lentils cooked up mushy enough for him, he couldn't get enough. I did everyhting up to the browning the rice and lentils stage as directed, and then poured it all in to my rice cooker with the 3 cups of water. Very easy and tasty.

However I do think that this dish could use a little spicing up, maybe next time I make it I will use ghee instead of olive oil, and add in some spices such as cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom, and whole peppercorn.

You can take the lid of the pot at the end if it's still too watery when the lentils are done.

[Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag],2012-12-09
81339,1802686496,5,1,"Very good recipe, though it could be healthier. Here are some tips: LENTILS: Use green or brown lentils. Red or yellow varieties will break down into mush. DO soak your lentils or they won&#039;t be quite cooked enough. Even 30 minutes in hot water will make a difference.  RINSE your lentils and jasmine rice to wash off excess starch. This will make the grains more distinct and less mushy in the finished dish. OLIVE OIL: I cut the quantity of olive oil in half to 1/4 cup and still got the desired flavor and texture. This is more than enough to fry the onions and flavor the dish. THE ONIONS will crisp up nicely in 15-20 minutes if the heat is high enough. The key is that the higher your heat, the closer you have to watch the pan and stir things to prevent burning. SEASONING: Like most of you, I doubled the cumin to approx. 2 tsp and it was great. Be generous with the pepper. I used a grinder and pretty much covered the rice and lentils before sauteing. Next time I will try reducing the salt a bit. There is a LOT of salt in this recipe and I suspect it will be just as good with half as much.   FINISHING THE DISH: After 20 minutes on the stove, I opened the lid, tossed the onions back in, then closed the lid and turned off the heat while finishing the rest of the meal.

I recently found a recipe in which the [very] thinly sliced onions are sprinkled with a bit of salt and flour, THEN fried for 6-8 minutes; this results in the wonderful crispy sweet onions that takes this dish to the next level. Also, I like to use basmati rice that has been soaked for at least 30 minutes, which produces a fluffy long grain that cooks faster. If you&#039;ve made this recipe and want to try a unique take on it, I recommend the recipe for Mejadra from the cookbook Jerusalem by Ottolenghi and Tamimi.",2015-05-27

255145,64642,0,0,"These pickles are fermented and cured for several weeks, much like sauerkraut.  During curing, colors and flavors change and acidity increases.  

Wash cucumbers thoroughly.  Be sure to remove and discard a 1/16-inch slice from the blossom end of fresh cucumbers. Blossoms may contain an enzyme which causes excessive softening of pickles. 

Soft or slippery pickles can be caused by several things (If spoilage is evident, do not eat):  1) Salt brine too weak during fermentation.
2) Cucumbers stored at too high a temperature during fermentation.
3) Insufficient amount of brine.
4) Pickles not processed properly (to destroy microorganisms).
5) Moldy garlic or spices.
6) Blossom ends not removed from cucumbers.

Scum on the brine surfaces while curing cucumbers is not uncommon.  Wild yeasts and bacteria that feed on the acid thus reducing the concentration if allowed to accumulate. Remove scum as often as needed.

Fully fermented pickles may be stored in the original container for about 4 to 6 months, provided they are refrigerated and surface scum and molds are removed regularly. 

Canning fully fermented pickles is a better way to store them. To can them, pour the brine into a pan, heat slowly to a boil, and simmer 5 minutes. Filter brine through paper coffee filters to reduce cloudiness, if desired. Fill jar with pickles and hot brine, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process in a boiling water bath.",2009-09-15

302202,160974,5,1,"This was VERY impressive looking and easier than I thought. The batter is quick to mix up and no more trouble to mix up than a one layer cake.  I followed the cake part of your recipe, but used the frosting from ""Smith Island Cake"" from ""Cook's Country."" It recommended lining the pans (I bought 10 foil pans and it was worth it!) with parchment. It takes some extra minutes but the ease the layers come out of the pan, then a quick peel off of the paper, makes it STRESS-FREE. Since the layers are so thin I feel certain they'd have stuck to the foil pans without the paper. It is a real treat to eat a 10 layer cake and makes for great table conversation.

328668,201581,5,1,Made as posted with Mock Chicken Stock Recipe #359988 from my freezer and very low in fat and sodium. I came home from shopping today chilled to the bone.

It is quick to make, which is a big advantage if you are sick and don't feel like cooking for long for example. We both enjoyed half of it with noodles and are going to have the other half with rice tomorrow. Next time I will follow the recipe fully just to see how different (and probably better) it would be.",2011-06-05

I still don't have the hang of roasting garlic and having it come out in a nice paste.  My dressing is kinda chunky. =D I had to use a masher to break up some of the garlic, but I like it chunky!  I used half a red onion and a couple more scallions.  Dissolved bullion cube as the broth.  
Tasty!  When it's chilled I'm going to mix it with some lettuce just the way it is.  Man does my fridge smell like garlic!",2007-01-15

The addition of salt went well with this recipe and took it to another level. Thank you, WI Cheesehead, for posting this wonderful recipe idea :0)<br/><br/>Update: I do not recommend adding the lime juice until you're getting reading to eat this dish.

I can't say that I measured the recipe exactly, in fact there was alot of garlic (3 big cloves), and since I had no Romano cheese, I used Asiago with the Parmesan. We will have this again soon.

172610,192581,5,1,"This sauce was very, very good despite being much lower in fat than regular Alfredo.  BF and I both highly endorse this recipe.  It was easy to make too.  I used a bit less olive oil and cheese, onion flakes instead of powder (was what I had) and the parmesan and romano cheese combination.  I'm not sure how to measure 2 cups of fettuccine (or is it fettuccini? - no, I don't know from Italian:D) so I served it over 6 ounces pasta for the two of us.  It was amazing how well the blended tofu mimicked the consistency of a good Alfredo sauce, and the two cheeses provided all of the necessary taste.  I didn't bother mincing the garlic since I figured the blender would do it for me.  BF and I were both pleased to have such a healthful alternative to traditional Alfredo sauce.  We served it with some fat free veggie soup for an extremely satisfying Fall dinner.  Thanks, I'd make this again!",2007-11-21
172610,353485,3,0,This was our first foray in to cooking woth tofu and overall we were happy with the results.  It is not quite the same taste or texture wise as traditional alfredo sauce however the savings on fat and calories are a plus - and are what will drive us to likely make this again.  The recipe was made as written save using all parmesan instead of the parmesan and romano mixture.,2008-01-20

I add nutmeg and pepper to it, and I have been using 16 oz tofu because that's the size it seems to come in around here. This last time I pureed a whole head of roasted garlic into the sauce as well. It is true, as another has stated, that it is best fresh and hot (in terms of consistency). We have been doing a lot of running lately, and the recommendation has been to eat a good protein meal the evening after the longer (10-11 mile) runs. This has good healthy protein, some carbs, and, along with some broccoli, is just a very healthy and satisfying meal.",2008-02-24

I chose the recipe mainly to use up a box of tofu in my cabinet, but I would actually buy more tofu just for this recipe.  Hey, the kids ate it willingly which is good!",2009-01-07

329856,279989,4,1,This recipe was good.  I was only cooking for myself and my two children so I used a smaller roast and adjusted the other ingredients as needed.  I couldn't find any turbinado sugar or star anise.  I used regular sugar and chinese five spice in place of these.  It was vary tasty and did live the house smelling great while it was cooking.  I used the leftovers in Recipe#328375 and they were very good.  Thanks for sharing.  Prepared for PRMR tag game.,2008-11-06
329856,330545,4,1,Not what I expected but very good nonetheless.  The words red-cooked had me believing this would have a reddish tint to the meat but it did not.

The newer fudge recipes are easier to make but don't have the wonderful texture of the old fashioned fudge.  The change I made was I cut the butter in half and added in 1/2 cup of chunky peanut butter along with the butter.  It gives the chocolate fudge a great flavor.  I also cooled the fudge faster by putting it in a sink filled with ice water, and I did stir in the peanut butter while it was cooling, and it didn't hurt the results at all.

They would be great with the addition of some mini semi sweet chocolate chips in the batter.,2009-11-05
257229,1292717,5,1,Simply amazing recipe. Easy to do and so moist. I didn't use the frosting recipe here but used a different frosting. I added a Rolo to each cupcake on top of a small layer of batter then put the remaining batter on top of the Rolo and followed the baking directions. Gives the cupcake that little bit extra something with the chocolate and caramel flavor in there. YUM!!!,2010-10-29

I took it to a pot luck and many people went back for a second, lots of compliments.I made two changes, I used a spice cake mix and  I used pumpkin pie filling and omitted the spices (because that&#039;s all I had- it worked wonderfully) The texture was light and moist.  I also made my own frosting using 1 pkg of softened cream cheese, whipped with about 1 cup of sifted powdered sugar.  I then whipped 2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream until very stiff and gently folded the two mixtures together.  Using a lg star tip I frosted the cupcakes then drizzled them with caramel (I used ice cream topping)  for a finishing touch I LIGHTLY sprinkled coarse salt (sea salt) on top.  The salt intensifies the caramel like none other!  All the flavors meld perfectly,  the extra light fluffy frosting really lets the pumpkin and caramel come through.  I will be making these all fall!!",2014-09-29

I would make some substitutions, though. It needs more water and less salt. I would go with ¬Ω cup water and ¬Ω%u2013¬æ tsp salt. And you know what's especially good added to pakoras?

The spice combination is perfect, the slight crunch of the almonds with the sweetness of the chocolate mixes perfectly. Your friend Barbie had an incredible eye for perfection. I will definitally be making this during the holidays. BTW, we had to try this while still hot, we couldn't wait. I assume that it will be even better after a day, if better is even possible.

You don't necessarily taste the cookies in the muffin, but they are REALLY great on top!!  Great texture.

86933,182624,5,1,"My two sisters who were coming for Christmas dinner love pretzels and all things spicy, so I decided to make this little snack for them.  They (among others) ate so many of them that they were hardly hungry for dinner!  I did change it up a bit by doubling the pretzel amount, leaving the dressing mix the same, using garlic powder (seemed like the pretzels would have enough salt on their own), and adding quite a bit of extra cayenne.  I added only the tsp. of cayenne to start, but then tasted it every time I stirred it and found almost every time that it needed more.  I have no idea how much I ended up using since I just shaked it over the top each time, but I'm guessing it was a lot!  Even so, it never got terribly spicy, it was just right!  I served it alongside ""#65678"" and ""#131582"", which made a kind of fun pretzel bar.  Four people asked for this recipe.  Who knew that pretzels would be the hit of my Christmas dinner?

These were done in about 55 mins and I'm glad I didn't have to wait long for them to cool.  They are sooo good, with a great flavor.  The ranch flavor is dominant because I chose to use very little cayenne, but the heat is there as a background flavor.  I don't think there will be enough to share with my bf! Lol!  The fat-free ranch dip I used has msg and dairy products which I shouldn't be eating due to IBS, but these are too good!  Thank you so much for sharing, Marlene!

I find it odd that only 1/4 pound pretzels be used when a similar, no-bake pretzel recipe indicates a whole pound be used with one package of the ranch dressing mix. I am upset I wasted the last of my pretzels on this salty mess :[ :::UPDATE:::So I made these again because I thought they had potential. They taste SO much better when you use at least 1/2 pound of pretzels, LESS THAN 1/4 cup oil, and ONE HALF package of ranch dressing mix.

Now sitting here wondering why I waited as the results were divine and the dish itself was so easy to prepare.  The wine, honey and cinnamon come together into a fragrant rich syrup that enrobes the fruit and gives a richness to the frozen yogurt.  More importantly, it goes beautifully with the figs and enhance their own flavor and sweetness. This is the kind of dish which can easily double or triple to impress a crowd for an occasion or event.  My one faux pas was that even after making a special trip to purchase them, I forgot to include the dried cherries.  Oh well, I guess I'll have to make another batch soon.",2007-04-06

Since I was making this a layer cake, I needed more frosting so I used 16 ounces of cream cheese.  I wanted less sugar in the frosting, so I used 1 cup of raisins, and 1 cup of powdered sugar along with 2 teaspoons vanilla and 2 teaspoons skim milk.   I whirled the raisins in the food processor and then added the other ingredients.

He used less oil and peanuts instead of cashews, though I think cashews definitely would have been better.

I used the same pot of water for the second egg (with the already added 1/2 C vinegar from the first egg) and by the time the second amount of vinegar was added it did leave a bit of vinegar flavor on my second egg.

I made the sauce exactly as listed, but used half of it in the crock pot to cook with and saved the other half to pour over at serve time.

The sauce is EXCELLENT...I did make some modifications due to the fact I didn't' have any soy or chili sauce but it turned out just fine. I substitute Catsup for chili sauce and teriyaki sauce for soy and I added about 8 shakes of hot sauce, my son likes a little ""KICK"" as he would say to his food. It didn't hurt the outcome of the recipe at all , If it tastes this good with the substitutes its probably amazing with the correct ingredient's. I will probably make extra and Cann it  to keep some on hand. If you have a sweet tooth this recipe is for you. If you find it to sweet just reduce the sugar and /or  use Lite pineapple.....

I halved the recipe, and dropped spoonfuls of it on top of my chili in a 8&quot; round casserole dish - my chili&#039;s a thick and chunky version, so the cornbread baked up very nicely on top.  Baked for 40 minutes, until it was nicely browned.  Even my husband, who is not a big cornbread fan, raved about the cornbread topping and went back for seconds.  This is definitely a keeper!!

I used an egg replacement product, oat milk + 1 Tbsp of vinegar, and vegan butter -- and these had a great light texture and were so good (unlike many of the dense gluten-free muffins we&#039;ve tried so far).  For others out there thinking about trying these, I found them very sweet (the author commented on that), and almost halved the sugar --they were still sweeter than most boxed corn muffin mixes, but still delicious.

373064,463202,4,1,"This is a good casserole, not sliceable but scoopable. A little spare in amounts, though.  I used half of a medium yellow onion, chopped, and a large garlic clove, minced.  Since I wasn't using leftovers, I started by putting water on to boil for the shrimp, then put my rice in my rice cooker.  I used Recipe #18157 because I am not too big on canned soups, so I measured out the dry ingredients for this while the shrimp boiled, then used the water from the shrimp to reconstitute the ""soup"", trying to give it some shrimp flavor.  I drained and peeled the shrimp, and defrosted a 16oz bag of frozen broccoli.  Then I sauteed the onion and garlic in about a tablespoon of butter, and continued on with the recipe as stated, subbing 2 cups of shredded colby jack for the velveeta.  Because I didn't have any children to feed last night, I added some Tony Cachere's seasoning (and could have added more!).  Topped with cracker crumbs and let sit a few minutes to ""meld"".  Yum!  I recommend having this recipe on hand for leftovers to reduce the work, although it was only about 30 minutes from start to finish (the rice finished cooking just at the right moment to put it in the casserole!).

I give it four stars because the dressing can be somewhat runny- and I do not put in the milk. It's likely because I use a bit more pickle juice! I substitute apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar. I recommend if you are going to use a whole box of salad macaroni, to use twice the amount of sweet pickles and twice the amount of olives. Also, I add some chopped celery to give it a bit more crunch! On the macaroni- make sure you drain it well!

I did have some misgivings about the whole idea, but it seemed straightforward at the onset. Fill and roll up dough, slice lengthwise, turn up to show filling. What happened was that the filling started to fall out when the dough was sliced - it's only chopped dates, walnuts, orange zest and sugar, no binding - and threated to fall out even more when I tried to manipulate it. I had to give up the idea of making a wreath, and just rolled up and sliced the already sliced pieces to make big, rather messy cinnamon roll shapes. Anyway, the rolls are very good. I'm not much of a fan of sweet icing, and since the wreath was impossible, I didn't bother to make the icing. It's very nice bread, but the presentation as written is not possible for me.

165969,286566,4,1,"I made these for the DS's recreation music group were they were well received but I think I really made a mistake in using a rich dark chocolate to coat them (my personal preference - I think they would have preferred a milk chocolate but it was all I had).  I got 21 large biscuits from the mix and baked them for 10 minutes at 150C fan forced oven and only used 200 grams of chocolate to coat (melted a 100 grams at a time in the microwave).

After we took it out of the oven, we added lettuce and tomatoes on top.

I didn't have crescent roles so I used the flaky kind and just separated the layers and spread it around. I used my pampered chef stoneware which worked great for this recipe. I also used plain taco chips and not nacho ones. Very good with a salad on the side for dinner...a kid-pleaser for sure! Thanks",2005-09-22

26723,333545,5,1,wonderful recipe.  I didn't have any sour cream so I did it without that but it was still wonderful.  But I am thinking the sour cream will just make this recipe better.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.,2008-05-26

172272,329769,5,1,*Reviewed during ZWT4* I loved this potato dish. I did use a little more oil than stated ...but that's OK. I did use a non-stick pan that helped a lot. I loved the garlic and paprika together. The wine at the end gave it just that little extra something. Great as a side to be included iin a gluten-free meal. Photo also to be posted,2008-05-27

172272,339260,5,1,A great fried potato recipe.  I always microwave my potatoes before frying them (unless I have leftover baked potatoes).  It gives the potatoes a much softer and flakier texture.  I loved the addition of the white wine in these potatoes.  Made for ZWT4.,2008-06-09

Knock me upside the head, but I never thought of starting potatoes in the microwave to make pan fried potatoes.  Doh!  Really easy to do.  I zapped these for 5 minutes then they were probably in the pan for 15 minutes or so.  I pretty much cooked them until the rest of dinner was done.  Easy recipe, minimal prep and a great flavor.

172272,47559,5,1,I rarely make pan fried potatoes although we love them - partly because I never have left over boiled or baked potatoes.

175643,131674,5,1,I really liked this recipe because it did not use any oil...the applesauce was the replacement.  I made this in an 11 x 14 pan instead of two pans.  Took the same time to bake.  I think that the cinnamon and applesauce were the key to this!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.,2006-07-09
175643,58892,4,1,"I baked it in an 11x14 pan too - and I'm glad I did. I wouldn't have had enough for 2 9x13.  Also I added a little bit more applesauce since the batter was too thick, I thought.   I wouldn't call them brownies though - they're more cake-like than a brownie. But they're easy, healthy and a great way to get the kids (and hubby!) to eat zucchini.  I'll definitely be making these again - great for school snacks.  (I didn't add the nuts because our school is nut-free).   ",2006-09-26

I increased cocoa to 1/2 cup and reduced sugar to 1-1/2 cups so I wouldn't feel as guilty about adding chocolate chips.  :D I baked in muffin cups, so they baked much quicker and only took about 30 minutes (and probably could've gone a little less, maybe 20-25 mins.).

456443,1145340,5,1,"We love this recipe!  My husband says it is equal to one of the entres at our favorite itallian restaurant. I made a few changes; cut it down to 4 servings so based on that used very rounded measures of the onion, carrots and celery.  I only had veggie broth and red wine on hand.  So used a 1/2 cup total of Sextant's Zin.  Was told to cook with wine you enjoy drinking.  Used 1 15oz can of trader joes organic tomato sauce and 3/4 tsp of dried thyme instead of fresh.  Also the only salt used was the pinch added to veggies while cooking, didn't need to add any salt thereafter as the flavors were so good.  Served it over pappardelle noodles with grated parmi and we are looking forward to making this for our friends at New Years.  For us the 4 servings really turned out to be 2 plus enough left over for 1 lunch.  Thank you for such a fantastic and easy recipe.",2011-12-15

Thank you ,my friend, for something that finally made him a happy camper. Super easy and quick for a pasta sauce. I did have to let it simmer slowly for closer to an hour and a half as he was late getting home. It didn&#039;t harm the sauce in any way and, in fact, it had a very deep and rich flavor.

268939,469903,5,1,I can't believe I am the first one to rate this spicy chicken soup!  It is DIVINE - I halved the recipe and used 1 can of white hominy.  I did not spend 2 hours on this soup; it can be done in 40-45 minutes.  I simmered after adding the browned chicken for 15 minutes and then another 15 minutes after adding the hominy... I just would never have had time to simmer a soup for 90 minutes.  My DH was raving about it and said 'we've got to make this one again.'

A warm dessert is welcomed in winter and this pear gingerbread pudding is something that you don't find everyday. The texture is like a mix of a soft pudding and a baked gingerbread which is unique and yummy. Mine was done at 22 mins. I'm so glad that I tried this. :D,2011-12-17

It only took an hour to cook for me until the center was firm and it was perfectly done. The cake came out super moist and delicious, the top rising over the pan.

I let my dough in pan rise for about 15 or so minutes and I think it did help the eggs not run so much. I baked my pizza probably closer to 20 minutes, covering with foil the last 7 minutes. The crust was light brown and eggs were still moist (not overbaked and dry). We'd had a similar pizza at the store Wegmans this morning and wanted to duplicate it. I used pre-made dough from their store, which made it real easy to put together. We all enjoyed it very much! It's a great way to enjoy a different kind of pizza.

134470,175727,0,0,"I didn't follow exactly either.

I made a Pizza Hut ABM, put into a pizza pan and made a lip/edge.  Added FRESHLY shredded then blanched shred. hash browns (cooled) and layed them on top, then cooked sausage, shred. cheese then a scrambled egg mix.. Well, it leaked all over the oven!  Took about 25 min to cook but you know what? Pretty darn original, good tasting and fun!

134470,351386,5,1,This is my wife's submission and I wanted to let you know how awesome this really is.  It's hard to get me out of bed on weekends but this does it every time!,2007-07-08
134470,208455,5,1,We all loved this.  Made as written except I had to cook my eggs first.  The egg kept running off the crust. I made the bacon and sausage the day before which made this really easy to throw together in the morning.  Will be making this again and again. Thank you!,2007-12-25
134470,324677,5,1,"Fabulous.  I made my own pizza dough.  Didn't have ham or sausage links on hand, just bacon.  My son declared this the best breakfast food he's ever eaten.  Will make again and again.",2008-06-22
134470,578836,5,1,This is excellent! I love the breakfast pizza at the local conveinence store and was thrilled to find an at home recipe for it.  I used rerigerated pizza dough from the can which needs to be baked for about 5 minutes before adding toppings.  Be sure and make tall edges around the pizza dough before adding the egg mixture as i quickly discovered!  LOL! Also I used store bought REAL diced bacon pieces (bits) to save time on the bacon frying.  Thanks for the recipe!!!,2008-06-28
134470,1082881,5,1,I had an extra pizza crust and we love the breakfast pizza's at the gas stations here. At first my husband and I were kind of nervous to try it because I thought it would be bland. We were wrong. It tasted just like the ones at the gas station. We both really enjoyed it. Very good. Thanks you for sharing =),2009-03-04
134470,76951,5,1,This breakfast pizza deserves it's name - it was amazing!  We only made it because DH was looking for something different for his work breakfast carry-in.  We made two - one for him and one to stay at home.  It was a great success at both places.,2009-07-23
134470,41509,5,1,It IS AMAZING!  We all loved it! I didn't add onions or ham (didn't have any) but it was DELISH with just bacon and sausage!  Definitely a keeper! THANKS!,2010-02-18

I also got Tyson precooked Ham pieces and sausage pieces. I also sliced up some onion. I scrambled 4 eggs and the 1/4 cup of milk. I cooked the pizza for 5 minutes on 400, took it out, poked it with a fork and put the egg mixture on top.. Then I decorated it with all the toppings (as much as I thought I'd like, I didn't go by the measurements here). I then baked it for about 9-10 minutes on 400 and it was perfectly done. Next time I'll add double if not triple what I originally added for toppings. It was pretty good, and I'll definitely make again.",2012-01-20

I brushed the crust with butter and then sprinkled garlic salt on it.  I used 2 eggs with the milk and spread on crust as the recipe states.  I then put the following meats on the crust  -- I used a pound of bacon, 1/4 lb of black forest Ham chopped, 1/2 9.6 oz package of Jimmy dean fully cooked hearty sausage crumbles, hard salami slices to cover and about 1/2 c proscuitto chopped.  I then covered liberally with the mozzarella and medium cheddar cheese.  I then drizzled about 2 Tbs of melted butter over the top and baked at temp indicated for about 20 min.

Used 3 eggs, 6 turkey breakfast sausages, and admit to using the crumbled bacon pieces that come in a bag out of pure laziness. In my large Doughmakers pizza pan coated with olive oil, used pizza dough recipe from KAF (2 t. Instant yeast, 2 T olive oil, 1 1/4 t salt, 3 c flour, 1c water). Didn&#039;t allow it a proper rise or prebake, but the pizza was perfect as is. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",2013-07-14

134470,400708,5,1,"OMG, this was so good, wish I could give it 10 stars.  Thanks FaerieEibhleann, I was looking for something a little differant and saw this and decided to give it a try.  Sure glad I did, it will not be differant any more but a family favorite.  Made this using Tracy K&#039;s recipe #56787 which I made the night before to save time(also an awesome and easy recipe) and followed your suggestion for frying up the toppings the night before.  Put it together in the morning, let it cook while I made coffee and didn&#039;t have to serve anything else with it.  It was a meal in itself.  We had plenty left over so re-heated it for lunch and it was still just as good as at breakfast.  By planning ahead and doing as much as possible the night before, this was a quick, easy and delightful breakfast.  No one will be sorry if they try this one out.  Update:  Continue to use this recipe adjusting fillings to suit what we want for the day, always good and even better the next day",2014-09-10
134470,2662829,4,1,"This breakfast pizza is delicious! I will be making it often. In the future, though, I&#039;ll prebake the crust for 5 minutes and find a way to use more eggs. Three eggs for 6-8 servings of pizza is too little for us. I think I will have to soft scramble the eggs until just so they won&#039;t run off of the crust and then follow the rest of the recipe as is. My mixture of 3 eggs and milk seeped off of the crust and under it (even though I did make the crust barrier around the edge) so I ended up with soggy undercooked crust. I only used ham and bacon since I didn&#039;t have any sausage, but I&#039;m sure it will be even more delicious with the sausage.",2014-11-06

I made a full recipe as written except that my salmon was grilled the nite b4, so I skipped prep step 3. What did surprise us was the lox flavor seemed missing, perhaps masked by being sauteed w/the onion. We loved it & it will be repeated without the mixed lox & onion saute to see if that allows the lox flavor to be more pronounced. Even if not, it would be terrific w/fresh salmon alone. Every scrap of this was gone in less than 24 hrs & DH even ate it for breakfast! Thx for sharing this keeper w/us.",2007-03-06

I don't like dill so I subbed a combination of basil, thyme, and Greek oregano; the flavors worked well together with the zucchini and feta and gave the dish a great zing. The second time I made it, I also added in some diced tomatoes at the very end ~ I don't know how they'd be with the dill but they were wonderful with the flavor combination of the other herbs, plus added some extra color to the dish. I will definitely be using this recipe again and again ~ thanks so much for posting! :)",2005-07-01

81150,227666,5,1,"First off, let me just say that I really dislike zucchini. I decided to make this for me when I noticed I had a zucchini lying around- and it was WONDERFUL!!! I didn't even used dill as I didn't have any, and I used reduced fat feta cheese. I didn't really measure anything; just kinda added a dash of garlic or feta cheese here and there. Lastly, just wanted to say that if I had a top ten list, this would definitely be on it. ",2005-11-30

81150,455539,5,1,"I skipped the oil altogether and just sprayed my (already non-stick) pan with Crisco butter flavored spray. I also pressed as much moisture out of the zucchinis as I could with a 'screen-type' strainer.  Then I sprayed a few sprays of 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter' spray on the zucchini as it cooked along. (It may not have even needed that.) 
I also tossed in some of the dried garlic flakes that I had on hand instead of minced. I tested this recipe this way using only ONE zucchini and only ONE tablespoon of feta cheese. My version only had 28 calories! The oil was not missed.  
I will make the larger ""batch"" of this for sure. Thanks for the recipe!",2007-03-17
81150,245378,5,1,Excellent recipe! My husband said that he would let me plant MORE zucchini plants next year so that I could make this again and again(This year all he did was complain about how my zucchini plants were overtaking his garden!)

81150,726142,4,1,"This was a nice a twist for zucchini and my new favorite cheese! The recipe should really tell you to press the moisture out before cooking. I didn't and after 7 minutes there was so much moisture than I dumped it into a strainer and then back into the pan. You could probably cut back on the olive oil too. My 10 yr old boy really liked this dish. I will definitely try it again with less moisture, less oil, and no dill (my preference).  =)   Thanks for the recipe!",2008-03-25
81150,199848,5,1,"This is terrific.  I loved the texture and the flavor that the dill and feta added.  It&#039;s very important to drain the excess moisture.  It might be nice to pop this in the oven for a bit to slightly brown the top, but it&#039;s fine just as written.  Thanx!",2013-10-07

I made this substituting the red bell pepper with yellow bell pepper. Also, I couldn't find any baby brown mushrooms, so I used regular fresh white mushrooms instead. Also, I had to use regular French beans but everything worked very well. I omitted the sugar completely{since she is on a sugar free diet}. The aroma of this dish while it was cooking is remarkable. It is in one word HEAVENLY! My mom and I enjoyed this for lunch this afternoon with rotis{Indian flatbreads}. This will be a regular on our table. Thank you!",2005-03-01

I made it for some quite ""tofu skeptical"" eaters, and they found it to be wonderful.  I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to add some soy or tofu into their diet, but have not yet aquired the taste for ""plain"" tofu yet.  I'm ashamed to say that I had to substitute 2 cups of leftover rice pilaf for the brown rice, since that was on hand at the time.  Also the swiss cheese was a really nice surprise!  Tasted terrific with all the other ingredients.",2004-01-15
78308,192581,5,1,"Nice recipe, though at first I thought it needed less tofu; then I realized that I had included a 12 ounce package of tofu, not just 8 ounces (12 was the smallest size I could find in the store).  So, this gets 5 stars if you use the specified 8 ounces.  I've never processed tofu like this, and it turned into a substance that looked like sour cream and gave the casserole a creamy consistency.  I used a bit of extra cheese, cooked the brown rice in vegetable broth and only added 1/4 teaspoon salt.  I used the basil instead of oregano.  We ate 2/3 of this for a one-dish dinner.  The colors on top were very pretty before I added the cheese and sesame seeds too, but I didn't take a picture of that:(  Thanks Barb!",2007-03-13

I used extra garlic and a whole can of artichokes and added a sprinkle or two of crushed red peppers.  The cooking time was perfect but we were looking for a bit more oomph.  To be fair to MsPia, I have to add that I did not use marinated artichokes because I'm not a fan of the taste of the marinade.  I used regular artichokes instead and increased the spices to offset this.  Because of this, I have revised my original rating.  Thank you so much for posting this Ms.Pia!

My  well-stocked gourmet pantry contained a Kraft macaroni dinner and a pkg. of chicken ramen. I wasn't going to add the flavor packet, but in the end I threw it in with the cheese sauce, butter and milk, stirred well, and had a terrific lunch. 

I had enough left to serve it last night with BBQ spare ribs and pineapple cole slaw, and my husband, who usually just tolerates my high regard for Kraft macaroni and Top ramen, thought it was delicious.

It is very easy to make, has such a great, crunchy crust with a mmmmm lovely tasting filling. 
We especially enjoyed the herb mix! I used 2 tbs fresh basil, 1 heaping ts of dried rosemary and thyme, cause thats all I had on hand. Im sure using all fresh herbs would make it even more outstanding!
Due to dietary reasons I used all whole spelt flour in the crust and left out oil, thus needing more water (about 7-8 tbs).
The tart baked up beautifully in the given time and looked very springlike and appetising. 
Ill surely make this again! THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this treat with us!

196300,50509,4,1,"We're exploring soups in Eastern European Forum this month and I thought this would be a good one to start with. This is such a nice soup. I used a gourmet blend of dried mushrooms that I soaked all day - I think you really get the most of dried mushrooms if you let them soak all day/overnight. I could not figure out how one would separate the mushrooms from the potatoes so what I did was to simmer the mushrooms for 40 minutes or so. I fished them out and dropped the potatoes in. I also added a bay leaf and some thyme. Once the potatoes were done I whirred it all with the immersion blender. I soaked the mushrooms in two cups of water, used about a cup of chicken broth that I had and then made up the rest with water. Be sure to use a good quality bacon with this - the bacon adds a lot of flavor. My soup was not very thick but just as I like it and of course you can thin it to the consistency you like. Used half-and-half instead of heavy cream.",2012-02-08

Made your recipe for dinner yesterday and it turned out super-great, as well as easy to make.  Our guests thoroughly enjoyed the chicken with the sauce.  I served the chicken over my Special 5 Rice Combination topped with crushed cashews.

I used 2% milk instead of the cream and accidently cooked the sauce down quite a bit, not dry but not as creaming as it should have been, got interrupted.  Never the less it was delicious!  We both loved it and I will make it again soon!  Thanks for a keeper!",2008-10-08

12794,1168372,3,0,"I made this tonight, and it was pretty good.  I wouldn't say it was fabulous, but I always like any dish with chicken and mushrooms.  It needed some other flavor, but I'm not sure what.  Maybe garlic would have helped, but my husband doesn't like garlic.  I served it with angel hair pasta, which is my favorite.  I did add basil to the flour, which did help the flavor of the chicken.",2009-05-30
12794,297076,4,1,"This was really good and had a great flavor. I think next time we'll try grilling the chicken or baking though without the coating (which totally made the chicken, but cutting back on the oil/flour around here!)",2009-06-03
12794,415934,5,1,"Loved this.  If you love the ""Diane"" flavor (as in Steak Diane or Chicken Diane) you'll love this.  I doubled the cream, mustard and lemon juice to get a lot of sauce.  It was delicious.",2009-09-01
12794,250238,4,1,I made this for dinner tonight. The sauce was good. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding minced garlic to the mushrooms and onions.

12794,452355,5,1,"This recipe is a keeper.  It is tasty, requires minimal prep, and is ready quickly.  It's perfect for a weeknight meal.  We used shiitake mushrooms which lent nice flavor to the dish.  Thanks!",2009-11-13
12794,371738,5,1,"Such a quick and easy, but more importantly, tasty dish!  I only used two breasts and pounded enough to get four out of them.  My boys ate all ""four"" and requested this meal again tomorrow.  The only thing I did different was use about 1/2 Tbs. dijon, since my youngest hates mustard.  He loved this dish---and then I told him there was mustard in the sauce!  So, truly kid-friendly!  Thanks Tebo.",2010-03-09
12794,1589193,5,1,This is YUMMY. The only change I make is to add capers with the cream. Our family has been making a recipe like this for years and we continue to enjoy it. Thank you for sharing it Candy.,2010-04-20
12794,477308,3,0,"I wasnt too impressed, but it may be my own fault! I was really excited about this dish and pretty much made to the recipe. I used half and half, not cream. i also put the chicken into the sauce and then let it all simmer together. There was barely a mustard taste in this, I guess I expected more. Oh well! It was okay, but I probably wont make again",2010-05-25

12794,1113712,5,1,"Awesome recipe !  Not a lot of prep, but tons of taste. In my opinion is you really need to add salt and pepper to the chicken before cooking it. We all know that chicken will be bland if you don't season it no matter what you put on top. I also added a dash of s&p into the cream mixture. You need it to make the flavors pop. This is a fantastic recipe and great for a weekday.",2010-11-18
12794,89514,4,1,"I made this and found it to be an interesting, different flavour. Though that may stand from using somewhat different ingredients - regular mustard, skim milk, and dried parsley. Still, it was pretty delicious, and I think I'll be making this again. Also, the simplicity is awesome.",2011-03-03

12794,668214,3,0,"This was pretty good even without the Dijon mustard, i swear I had a bottle somewhere.... should have double checked before going along with this recipe but still was very good. my boyfriend who doesn't really like mushrooms gobbled up this recipe and licked his plate clean! The sauce is very good. ;)   I served it with some rice pilaf, nice combination :)   I will try it again with the dijon, and maybe I'll boost it another star!!",2011-11-14
12794,1752739,0,0,"Excellent. When it was time to make the sauce, I added a 1/2 white wine with the cream and it really gave it a tangy flavor. Will enjoy this for a long time. Thank you",2012-01-11

12794,2518745,5,1,"I actually used Sour Cream instead of light cream (because I didn't have any) and it was excellent. What a great recipe. I did not get the chicken breasts down to 1/4"" and so had to cook them longer (traditional 'until the fork pierces and juice runs clear') but wow was this yummy!",2013-02-28
12794,271925,5,1,"This is a lovely recipe!  I made as is, with the exception of using 3/4 cup of cream, and a healthy dash of worcestershire sauce in with the onions and mushrooms.  Although I did increase the cream, I left the other measurements the same, and it thickened nicely and was the perfect taste treat, for me.  I made this tonight, and have already passed it on to a friend.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for sharing this goodness!",2013-03-18

12794,951133,5,1,This was really good!  I followed the recipe but didn&#039;t have fresh parsley so I used 1t. dried parsley and it came out fine.  Next time I won&#039;t use my iron skillet as I think it gave the sauce an odd color.  After I made the chicken I plated it and placed it in a 200 degree oven while I was making the mushrooms and onion.  Thank you for posting!,2013-04-25
12794,13796,5,1,This was delicious...  hands down. We loved it.,2013-04-29
12794,2264777,5,1,"I made this yesterday and the wife and I both enjoyed it.  When shopping for this recipe, I couldn&#039;t find light cream any where, so I had to go with heavy cream.  I also seasoned the chicken prior to dredging it in the flour.  Otherwise, I made the recipe to a tee.  The wife really enjoyed the pop of lemon juice and the sauce was nicely thick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I make this again, however, I will change a couple of things.  I will use 2 cups of mushrooms.  It just needed more, fo me.  The parsely I could just leave out altogether.  It didn&#039;t seemed to do anything for the dish at all.  If I happen to have parsley on hand, I would use it, but I would not purchase any parsley just to make this dish.  I liked one reviewers usage of the worchestire sauce and wouldn&#039;t mind trying that.",2013-07-28
12794,1274599,5,1,My husband and I made this together and it is fantastic.  Per jijill&#039;s suggestion I increased the cream to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of chicken broth to make more sauce.  We served a green salad and garlic mashed potatoes with it.  This recipe is a keeper.,2013-08-12
12794,7388775,5,1,This was a HUGE winner with my family. I made it with shitaki mushrooms and actually added probably closer to a cup and a half of mushrooms and used cilantro instead of parsley. This was an instant hit and people are already asking when I am going to make it again!,2013-09-18

12794,1800056639,5,1,"Fabulous easy recipe. The chicken turned out very moist and flavorful. I chose to finely chop the mushrooms, in order to bring out their flavor a bit more. Served over egg noodles, which I would warn against simply because they get cold so quickly when served by themselves. My wife HATES mustard, so she was apprehensive when she saw me break it out while cooking, but we both thoroughly enjoyed the meal. This one is a keeper.",2013-12-03

12794,47510,4,1,"I doubled the sauce ingredients and added some salt and pepper to the sauce.  I really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe, but it wasn&#039;t to my husband&#039;s tastes.  Oh well, too bad for him, that just leaves more for me!  The recipe was super easy to make and really didn&#039;t take all that long.",2014-06-01
12794,2000195984,3,0,"I wasn&#039;t crazy about this recipe, but from the looks of the other reviews, it might just not be for me. Actually, I&#039;m pretty sure it would have tasted better if I hadn&#039;t made so many adjustments, but I figured I might as well leave a review in case others were curious about making similar modifications in their attempts. I&#039;m a big fan of recipes that are forgiving when substituting. I swapped out the cream with almond milk, the butter with spreadable butter/canola oil, the flour with Bisquick, and the dijon with regular mustard. I also added some soy sauce. I didn&#039;t use any fresh herbs, the chicken breasts I got from the market were a little on the thin side, and the lemon that I had was a little long in the tooth, lacking some of the juice and tartness that it might have once had. 

Anyway, it was alright. My family enjoyed it much more than I did. To me, it seemed like it wasn&#039;t quite there. Something was missing. My father agreed that adding some more lemon might have brightened the dish a little more, enhancing the flavor. I think this dish might be one of those dishes where you have to follow it a little more closely. Next time I make it, I might also add balsamic, more veggies, including sun-dried tomato, and serve it with pasta.",2015-05-25
12794,2000373556,5,1,An excellent recipe! I made exactly according to the recipe (using cilantro instead of parsley as mentioned).

12794,1530765,3,0,This was okay. An incomplete version of a classic restaurant reduction sauce. Needed tweaking. Deglazed the mushroom/onion saute with white wine &amp; homemade chicken stock and a sprig of thyme. Reduced it before continuing with the cream. Those tweaks saved it. Absolutely NO need for the Dijon mustard. That would've destroyed it. Wine added the necessary acidity. Chicken was cooked to perfection and was the best part of the meal. Served with mashed potatoes. I'll just stick to my own recipe for this dish.,2017-09-21
12794,2001047423,5,1,"I don't know what chicken breast halves look like, not sold in uk but I made escalopes as stated (If breasts had been particularly plump I would have chopped them). Didn't bother with 'pouring chicken juices in', just returned the chicken to the sauce - the lovely, beautiful, tasty sauce!!! I don't see this as a 'restaurant' meal, just the type of meal my parents &amp; grandparents cooked - long before French-inspired 'sauce' meals became trendy (and being working-class Brits, they didn't experience restaurant dining until after the wars either, but did cook sauces themselves as domestic servants)! I assume this is mashed potato in the pic, I was going to mash but because the veg cooked quick, I left the potatoes in chunks (typical British presentation); served with carrots, chopped cabbage, peas &amp; sweetcorn. That's the first time, I have made it many times since with mash &amp; rice, even cornmeal. Superb with anything!!!",2017-11-26
12794,2001841852,3,0,"This is a play on the original 'Chicken a la King' recipe, excluding wine or brandy. I made it, as I am a Calorie Counter, wanting to keep my calorie intake down. I used Fry Light, Sunflower Spray instead of oil, and Fry Light Butter Spray to saute onions/mushrooms, on low heat. I added 1 tbs of fresh thyme, because reading the contents, this recipe appeared pretty tasteless to me, and I doubled the mushroom content. Plus made Thai rice to add some texture, as opposed to mash, presented in the picture. It's an easy recipe, as is 'Chicken a la King', an old staple. If you are not counting Calories, add either wine or brandy for de-glazing, it really will liven this rather bland recipe. I will save some Cals to do this next time!

The only problem was that none of the garlic would 'stick' to the artichokes in the egg wash and I think it may be a better way to go to combine the garlic with the panko or to use some garlic powder (something I don't normally do).

77078,114965,4,1,"I did away with the white wine because of the kids. Instead, I added a cup of fresh milk and it tasted wonderful ! Both adults and kids loved it so much they asked me to make it again the next day. I used salmon and Alaska fish fillets.  Instead of chicken bouillons, I used leftover chicken broth instead. I dont favor using chicken bouillons in soup because after some time, you can detect the monosodium glutamate in them in any soup. With salmon, you dont need artificial flavoring, the taste itself makes sumptuous soups. Natural is best and gives out a slightly thicker consistency. I will definitely use this recipe over and over again. Thanks for sharing !

77078,169430,4,1,First let me say that 4 servings became 2 tonight. The tomatoes really cooked away into the soup so I just picked out the skins at serving time.

The actual flavours of the cake and sauce were good.  However, the sauce never thickened as I would have expected in this type of dessert.  The sauce consistency was liquid, like hot lemonade, and there was way too much of it.  The ""pudding"" or cake part was quite doughy.  Maybe I did something wrong?  Perhaps there is a missing/mistyped ingredient? ",2005-11-10

I sprinkled liberally with garlic pepper and garlic powder blend and used ready cooked bacon. I used 7 large eggs (was wondering since others used various amounts). I didn't have a pie plate and layered two tortillas in a oblong pan (probably pretty close in size). This turned out great. The combo of flavors is so tempting that even my family liked it (not spinach lovers). I really liked my combo of cheeses and will do it that way again. The bacon added a great flavor, too.

I baked it at 180 degrees C for 25 minutes. The only things different were the garlic (you just can't roast it in a hurry , so it was a bit raw)and the pepper - I used the normal one.

Actually, if anyone is looking to reduce carbs they could cook it with kitchen paper and omit the tortilla completely - same flavour an when you don't have that 'crust' then it just blends in with the egg.

115110,59801,5,1,Fabulous!!!  Both of my kids ate it.  My oldest isn't usually a fan of Spinach so this was a surprise.  I put this together at the last minute so I didn't use roasted garlic.  I subbed a bit of garlic powder.  I used the recommended 5 eggs.  Probably only 1 1/2 cups of spinach as that was all I had on hand.  For the cheese I used a 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar then 2 sliced of colbyjack and 1/4 cup mozzarella.  It cooked in exactly 30 minutes.  Thank you for posting.  This will be one I come back to often.  The prep work was so very easy and quick.,2007-12-01

I will definitely make this again.",2008-01-02
115110,261510,5,1,I love this recipe!!  I know I've rated it in the past but can't find it anywhere.  It's very versatile and I'm still amazed at how the tortilla holds up so well.  It's very veggie-friendly!  I've used egg beaters with the same outcome.  Thanks for a great recipe.,2008-01-05

115110,234315,5,1,WONDERFUL RECIPE.  I used four grated cheese and 4-5 cups of spinach. Sauted the garli. Used peppered bacon no lemon pepper or salt.  Have to send the recipe home with our friends and definitely make again!!,2008-01-25

115110,442988,5,1,"I made this for Puppy Bowl Sunday (since we watch the Puppy Bowl instead of Super Bowl).  Very good!  I had some problems with this, but they were all my fault and not the fault of the recipe -- if you use a deep, narrow pie dish instead of a regular pie dish, the egg mixture takes longer to cook, so the top gets a bit crustier than is good ... again, that's my fault!  Time to buy a new Pyrex pie plate.  Anyway, this is a keeper, and I'll definitely make it again.  Loved the idea of using a tortilla as the crust -- wonderful touch.

I usually half the recipe (but still use one tortilla) and put it in a deep dish. It does take slightly longer to firm up (but I cover with foil if its getting too dark). I use the roasted garlic and the flavour goes so wonderfully with the spinach. Hubby is a spinach hater but even he loves this pie. I dont use the bacon, and I use a mix of mozerella and sharp cheddar cheese. Heavenly. I now make this atleast twice a week. My favourite lunch time dish.

We ran out of eggs so I only used 1 whole egg and the Egg Beaters equivalent of 4 eggs.  We also used frozen cut leaf spinach (thawed and squeezed of moisture) enough to be about 2 c.  We used skim milk, and the first layer of 1/2 c. cheese we used was cheddar, while the other 1 c. was a mix between taco blend (colby and jack), and mozzarella.  The mix added some nice change, I think.  Also, we're semi-vegetarian, so we used 2 Tbl. bacon bits (shh they're vegan!).   I roasted my own garlic earlier that day, and added an extra clove since we like garlic so much!  Overall, it was quick and easy!  I served it with homemade garlic bread since you really could pick it up like pizza.  Thanks a bunch!",2008-03-02

I really liked the flavor and texture, though my baking time was double what this recipe recommended.

Step #4 is confusing, so submitted this as a correction:""Sprinkle remaining cheese and the spinach onto tortilla in layers, and press gently."" I make it with no bacon for a vegetarian version, and have sued no milk when I didn't have any--still works fine Minced garlic from ajar works fine too. I bought a glass pie dish at a thrift store just for this recipe, and I'm glad I did! Fits a tortilla perfectly, which I'm much more likely to have on hand than a pie crust.",2008-06-12

I used colby monterrey blend cheese but next time I'll use sharp chedder and swiss because..well, because those flavors will go very nicely with the spinach.  Bagged spinach made this very easy.

Also, I didn't have lemon pepper so I used salt, pepper, onion powder and a little Tabasco. I used shredded Monterey Jack cheese and turkey bacon, as that is what I had on hand and it was great!

The only downside of making it this way is that you can't fit as much cheese into a muffin tin!  I will be keeping them in mind for future brunches.  Thanks!",2008-11-12

I used pepper jack cheese and added a few extra spices.  I had no garlic except for powder, used some herbs de provence, dehydrated minced garlic, a dash of salt, and some cayenne.

I had substituted the flour tortilla for a tomato one - BAD MOVE! but it was all i had. oh well. i think it would be much better with a traditional tortilla.  i also made a lot of changes to make it healthier. my version had mushrooms and a little onion. i also used fat free cottage cheese instead of shredded cheese and milk mixed with the eggs and on the top i just used a tiny sprinkling of shredded cheese over top lots of bread crumbs, for a lower-fat topping. my version was good, but tasted like it was: healthy.

115110,401320,5,1,"I have made this recipe twice. The first time I made it, I prepared it exactly as called for in the recipe except for the lemon pepper and the bacon (don't eat meat). It was ok, good actually but nothing to rave about. (I actually didn't think I would make it again as I already have a hard time getting the kids to eat spinach and I didn't need a recipe to make it any harder. )
The most I would have given it was three stars.
The second time I made it, it was much MUCH better.
I cut up plenty of onions and garlic ( I love both) and sauteed the spinach in them. I added some steak seasoning I like to use ( a blend of herbs and spices) and I squeezed a liberal amount of lemon to give it a slightly tart taste -to replace the lemon pepper. 
Then halfway thru I realized I had NO eggs! I was going to make a soy flour mix that you can usually susbstitute eggs for in baking recipes but something told me to abandon that idea. After dumping my soy flour concoction in the compost bin I decided that the eggs in the recipe probably served as a binder so I thought that I would just forge ahead without a substitution. But then I saw that I had some evaporated milk lieing around so I used that instead. I drizzled it on top, sprinkled some permesean cheese and it turned out Oh so GOOD!!!

I've decided to omit the eggs entirely and follow this version. Oh and I used cheddar cheese on mine. This goes into my regular rotation AND the kids loved it!!!

I made two of these ""pies"", along with bacon and other egg dishes and they ate every bit of them.
I followed the recipe except that I forgot to get garlic so I added garlic powder to the eggs.  The one thing I will do differently next time (and there will be lots of next times!)  is to layer the bacon with the spinach and cheese.

I sauteed veggy bacon; when that had cooled a little, I chopped it while sauteeing onions &amp; the garlic; I then added them to the egg mix. I was, ahem, more generous with the cheese! I used cheddar/Mexican (which in UK has red/green peppers &amp; spices in it &amp; is deep yellow). Next time, I'll try Blue cheese. The recommended servings were TINY - 5/6 people?

115110,2002321927,0,0,"I wont rate the recipe because I made modifications when I tried it. But here are some tips and thoughts based on my experience: 1. The glass pie plate worked out fine, but I realized while it was in the oven that an iron skillet might have worked even better. With a seasoned iron skillet, there wouldn't be a worry about the tortilla sticking (whatever your size of tortilla in comparison to skillet size), and you can easily preheat the skillet with some butter; put the tortilla on the hot butter; and pop it in the oven beore filling for a few minutes for a crispier crust. 2. The reviews that indicate this could benefit from more flavor are true. I doubled the lemon pepper and added another herb/spice mix. I don't recommend adding more salt, as the cheese already has plenty. I would recommend choosing your seasoning based on the cheeses (for example, if doing a feta-based mix, I'd go in a more Greek direction...lemon is good as is anything you'd add to spankopita). 3. I am a vegetarian and worried about not adding bacon (given the &quot;needs more flavor&quot; reviews), so I threw in some veggie sausage I had on hand. That was fine but unnecessary. It would have had enough on its own. If anything, it muddled the flavor direction. 4. My wife and kids ate it without complaint but when asked for feedback said it was too much spinach (I packed it when measuring). I, on the other hand, thought it was the right amount of spinach but also too much cheese. They didn't agree about the cheese. 5. The tortilla need not determine the flavor direction of the dish. I had buttered the bottom of the pan, and my family thought I had made the crust with potatoes (the egg mixture rose quite a bit and my tortilla was small, so there were no visible crust edges). The flavor of everything else overpowered the tortilla.",2018-11-05

85161,383557,4,1,"While I have eaten grits before I'm not even a little bit Southern.  These were very good.  But, as expected, the butter broke out of the grits.  I find it hard to believe that this isn't supposed to happen and the butter did separate early on in the cooking process. This didn't keep them from being delicious though.  

I was a chef for many years and I'm no stranger to cooking polenta or corn meal mush.  I have no fear to practically any amount of butter in a dish, I just prefer that it not break out of the mixture.  

I didn't make the dish exactly according to recipe.  I didn't have any more chicken broth, either fresh or canned so I had to make do with a chicken base.  I only had about 1 1/4 cups of cream so I made up the difference with whole milk.  I used course grits/polenta made from yellow corn.  I also took the two Tbs. of butter for the corn from the 1 cup of butter for the grits.  I also didn't add the Creole seasoning even though I had some because I really love the flavor of corn by itself.  None of these should cause the breaking of the butter from the grits.  

Despite the puddles of butter this was delicious and my 9 and 12 year olds loved it.  In the past I've made many batches of Italian polenta and it's essentially the same thing but with different ingredients added. I've never had butter or olive oil break out of a batch of polenta but then again, I've never used equal parts fat and polenta. ;~}  Sure was good though!

85161,50509,5,1,"What a wonderful dish. I did not use any seasoning other than salt and pepper, and used half-and-half instead of whipping cream. I sauteed the corn, melted the butter and then put everything in the rice cooker. I added some more grits, because the rice cooker conserves liquid (or could have reduced the broth/cream). The rice cooker is great because you don't have to stand and stir or worry about the pot boiling over. I am going to try reducing the butter by half next time, as I suspect it will work well and the calorie saving will be substantial. Update: I made this again, using 1% milk and a total of 2 oz. butter for half the recipe. I used 1 cup of corn, again for half the recipe. It's still really good. Is the version using cream better - well, yes. But the reduced fat version is still very very good, and I can indulge in that one more often. I liked having more corn, as this really was what attracted me to this dish.",2008-04-06

251802,286566,5,1,Three of us have just demolished this which was served over steamed vegetables and a quarter of a deli roast chicken.  I was apprehensive that it would have a raw flour taste if the flour was not cooked off first before other ingredients were added but this did not happen.  Could not get out to the herb garden (it was bucketing down rain) so used a teaspoon of dried mixed italian herbs.  Used a whisk to stir together to smooth out the lumpy cottage cheese.

251802,200862,5,1,"Made for Photo Tag, May 2008. You deserve 5 stars, because completely inadvertently I left out the flour ...  Yet the sauce still came out  perfectly delicious. I offer this reason: I had to use up the last of a really, really thick creme fraiche, lovely to cook with, and I also used more Parmesan, maybe 2 - 3 tablespoons, because I thought 4 teaspoons sounded very little. So the hot sauce ended up beautifully thick and not runny at all, as can be seen on the photograph!! In fact, if I'd added the flour, it would have been too thick because of my cream and the extra Parmesan. The taste was absolutely spot-on, with the lemon and herbs just coming through nicely. An ideal sauce for pan-fried fillets. I used fillets from a South African white-fleshed sea fish called Roman, which has a nice reddish skin and a mild flavour. Thanks, Engrossed!!",2008-05-15

204006,560905,5,1,"I found this same recipe in our local weekly free paper, the Merchandiser, last summer, and have made it 3-4 times since.  Felt it was excellent enough to share here but found it was already posted.  This recipe has trumped my tried-and-true baked bean recipe as our favorite.  The combination of ingredients is the perfect mixture of hot and sweet, and the heat can be adjusted with the amount of chipotles used.  I ususally tinker with recipes but have not changed a thing about this one (other than skipping the parsley if I don't have any on hand.)  This recipe also works well in a crock pot, cook about 8-10 hours on low.  I did leave the crockpot lid propped open at the end to thicken the beans a bit more.  This recipe is well worth trying!",2008-07-08

192164,137838,5,1,This is such a cute idea.  I'm always afraid to try things like this because they never work but this one was GREAT!!  I used icing instead of chocolate chips and Gingerbread cookies instead of sugar cookies.  Otherwise followed directions.  Thanks Wildflour!!,2007-10-28

192164,168462,5,1,"I made these for my son's grade four class and sent the extras into my husbands work. They loved them. I could not find pre-made sugar cookie dough, so I used recipe#40470 and for the icing recipe#64015. They were quite a bit of work but worth the effort. They looked quite impressive when they were all set out on the tray.  Thanks Wildflour for such a unique Halloween treat.",2007-11-01
192164,319189,5,1,"Ok, I Absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I sent these to my son's Kindergarten Class before Halloween and they were so excited about them that they didn't want to eat them.  I also changed it up a bit.  Instead of using cookies as a head stone, I used Halloween Graveyard Goodies which were little headstones with an extra treat inside.  Absolutely Perfect.  No baking involved.  Also instead of using frosting for the coconut to stick, I used the marshmallow Fluff.  Overall, I recommend these to anyone.  Very simple and yet so appealing.  thanks.",2007-11-09

192164,22015,5,1,These are great.  I made them up for a co-worker's 50th birthday party.   Really cute idea.  I had some issues getting the cookies to not spread out too much.  Instead of toothpicks I used royal icing (Mirj's recipe) which worked great to hold the tombstones up.,2008-10-29

I cheated and bought already made rice krispie treats (all were the same size..lol).  I didn't use the toothpicks since it was going to school.  I used a toothpick to write the words with the black decorator gel.  I think I bought pumpkins that were to big, but all turned out okay anyway.",2008-10-30
192164,763153,5,1,These were really fun to make.  I used only frosting to seal the cookie to the Rice Krispie treats and it worked fine.  I couldn't find any candy pumpkins.  They never seem to be anywhere when you are actually looking for them.  Instead I used gummy worms and they looked great.  People commented on how creepy they looked with the worms,2008-10-31
192164,859823,3,0,"This makes a very cute presentation but if you live in a moist state like Florida you might have a problem. I bought the store bought cookie dough and it did not need any extra flour. As the cookies bake they really spreads out.  As soon as they come out of the oven I had to trim them all to look like head stones again because they looked like blobs. Work quickly they set up fast. After frosting the cookies they became very most and some broke. As for writing with the gel, I also tried using a toothpick but it was a pain so I went to my trusty piping bag and used Royal frosting to write on the cookies. All in all it came out well, I put the broke cookies across the tombstones and it actually looked more authentic. The guests were thrilled and how can rice crispy treats attached to a sugar cookie not taste good? Thanks for the recipe.",2008-10-31
192164,592245,5,1,We had fun.  I made my own cookie dough as we cannot buy plain cookie dough in Australia.  I made the cookies in shape of headstones and then covered them in grey icing (frosting with black colouring).  We then added more black to leftover icing for the writing.  We too did not have any halloween lollies so we used worms.,2008-11-01
192164,358544,5,1,We had a lot of fun making these. Although I am def. not a good sculpture!! I did not have a cookie cutter to make tombstones so I free handed it. But nevertheless the party at daycare was a hit and the kids gobbled them up!! Thank you for such a fun and very easy recipe!!,2008-11-09
192164,294455,5,1,"I made these for my son's kindergarten Halloween party and the children LOVED them.  What I like best about them is, since I had to make a ton of them I could buy everything ""pre-made"" and just assemble it, so it went much quicker than if I had to make everything from scratch first.  It was pretty time consuming assembling them, but worth it for the kids!",2009-10-19
192164,961707,5,1,"Loved these. I had a tombstone cookie cutter so I used that instead of making my own tombstones. These were delicious and the rice krispy treats turned out perfect. The trick is really to put your stove on the lowest heat and wait and wait. It takes forever, but this will give you soft and chewy rice krispy's as apposed to hard ones. The hardest part for me was sticking the toothpicked cookies into the rice krispy treats without messing up the frosting on the cookies. Great recipe though",2009-11-01

192164,1418997,5,1,"This was such a fun and easy Halloween treat! I had too many little ones coming to our party and didn't want to use toothpicks to anchor the tombstone cookies.  I cut the rice krispie treats in two parts and dipped one end on each piece into the chocolate.  I then placed the cookie in between the two chocolate dipped ends and pressed them together with the cookie sandwiched in between them.  This was soo easy and worked great because the chocolate hardens once dried.  Plus, once you cover the chocolate with coconut grass, you cannot see any excess chocolate.",2010-12-30
192164,1387013,0,0,"Like the person from Fla said, my cookies did not come out right at all.  However....I was not tricked!  I had Biscoff cookies in the cupboard, and did 2 per Rice Krispie treat vs one cookie.  I frosted the backside of the cookie which was level vs the front which has a design on it.  My husband loves the idea...I made them for him to take to work tomorrow.  I bought store bought rice krispie treats in the value pack...so I got 16 treats.  At Walgreens they had packages of pumpkins and candy corns that were just about perfect for making these.  I dumped the extra candy corn in the pan for the grazers!",2011-10-30

The other thing that impressed me was how much I enjoyed the flavors of the Rice Krispy bar with the chocolate and the coconut (I left it un-toasted too-it was still fabulous!)-delicious! It was fun coming up with different sayings for the tombstones and this ended up being one of my favorite new recipes for the Halloween season.

208551,131126,5,1,Great flavor in these sandwiches and easy to assemble! The sweet onion flavor really shines here.  I baked on a foil lined pan and  watched until the bottoms & tops of the rolls were crispy.  (we didn't want soggy bread).  Next time I will reduce the poppy seeds by half.  There was far too many on the sandwiches for us.  I can see this being a hit at a tailgate or backyard party.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!,2012-05-14

334085,169430,5,1,"This is one of those recipes that I wish I could give more than 5 stars. The bread it makes is nothing short of perfect. The texture is ideal, it bakes perfectly, it's incredibly easy to work with and it tastes wonderful. I replaced the butter with Canola so the fat would be a healthier sort, used Splenda for the honey and skim milk. The tops were brushed with just egg white. I really can't rave enough about this. They rise like crazy too. If your looking for a sure thing bread recipe you've found it. This recipe has just become my standard!!  Made for My 3 Chef's Fall '08.",2008-11-11
334085,791416,0,0,"Hmm. I'm not quite going to give this any stars because of problems I ran into. First off, after I started, I realized I didn't have a thermometer. I microwaved the milk until just warm to touch, and hoped that was enough. Also, I used instant yeast that was overdue... whoops. My dough seemed very wet and I ended up adding loads of flour, though I still dont think I added enough because they rose very little, and do not resemble Annacia's puffy bun photo. They are a fair bit dense, and again I think thats to do with too much liquid (which I also think was emphasized due to the wet day I made them). They were still yummy to eat, just not what we had expected. I'm considering trying these again, but with proper equipment.",2009-04-12

406895,1882158,3,0,The tofu mixture was very tasty. The sauce tasted like vinegar and was way too thin. Might make this recipe again but with a different sauce.,2011-04-15
406895,494084,5,1,DH and I really liked this.  The flavor was good and I just loved the crunch of the lettuce with the soft texture of tofu and snap of the water chestnuts.  Based on other reviews I made the sauce in a saucepan and brought to a boil before adding a bit of cornstarch (dissolved in a little water).  This added a little body but I don&#039;t believe changed the flavor which was really quite good.  The only negatives were that it took forever to chop the vegie&#039;s and it was virtually impossible to get the iceberg into cups.  Next time I might use butter lettuce to simplify although i will really miss the crunch of the iceberg.  Thanks for the great recipe SAHS...,2014-05-21

86691,1803190896,4,1,"As you said, typically a little bland, but I like to use a mix of lemon juice and powdered sugar to spruce it up. To determine how fluffy it is, is how much you mix/whip it. If you mix it very gently, you get a very flat pancake. If you whip it with a whisk, it&#039;ll inflate like a balloon. This is because the air that you&#039;re adding to the mix will expand when it&#039;s heated.",2015-12-02

 Of course we cut the recipe down to 26 , rounded off the amounts, added 2/3c evaporated milk , instead of water and milk. Used butter instead of lard. Lard not being a staple in our home. . We couldn't bring ourselves to add a whole teaspoon of nutmeg, just used a 1/4 tsp and turns out we  should have used at least a half  teaspoon . Fried at 350 in 1"" deep vegetable shorting , we will use deeper oil next time. Burned a couple at the bottom of the pan until we got the timming right .These cooked in a flash.You need to turn once to brown both sides.
Mom and pop both loved them , just missed the big nutmeg taste, should have known .

I had to substitute chorizo, but will certainly keep an eye out for chourico for a future meal.  Lots of great things go into this, so it's no suprise it's so tasty.  And when you can do everything in one pan, it's that much better for me.  = ) Skipped the bell peppers,even though they make it look prettier, I don't particularly care for them.  Thanks for helping to make dinner unordinary.",2007-06-28
226218,288218,5,1,"An excellent recipe. It has it all in one pan. Easy to make and full of taste and colours. I used a greek sausage that is very similar to chourizo but I didn't change anything else. My family, all of them, gave a 5 star review. Its a keeper. Thanks for sharing!",2007-07-24
226218,395482,4,1,"Very good. Next time I will add 1/8 - 1/4 tsp crushed peppers while sauteing the tomatoes, paprika and saffron; to bring some kick to the taste. Or perhaps a mildly hot sausage, to counter the mild flavors of the chicken and shrimp. I skipped the baking part. Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat to simmer and cook for 25 minutes. Stir in the shrimp and peas (I omitted the asparagus) and cook for an additional 10 minutes. Thanks for posting!",2007-08-07
226218,357754,5,1,"I had to make paella for 70 people, and this was the recipe I used. What an amazing recipe! I had to print it out for at least 20 people since the wedding I cooked it for. The only changes I made were to add 1 tsp. fresh thyme to the chicken/rosemary mixture, double up on the onions,
and substitute smoked paprika for sweet paprika. I also omitted the baking part, and just finished it on the stove on low heat to cook the shrimp. Thanks for posting this fantastic dish!",2007-12-18
226218,234471,5,1,"I've made this delicious and very easy dish 3 times. It's so pretty, it makes a perfect entree for company. The taste is better than what I've had in restaurants. The first 2 times I used bulk chorizo sausage, rolling it into smallish balls and browning them in olive oil (my store didn't have links). That worked well and tasted good the first time but the second time they wouldn't hold their shape.  For the 3rd time making this dish, I ordered Portuguese chourico on-line. It came in links and was already cooked, so I added it in with the browned chicken thighs (which I cut into pieces). The flavor of the chourico blended wonderfully with the other ingredients. This recipe makes a fairly hearty amount for 6 people, but there won't be enough for seconds or leftovers. Thank you for posting my new favorite recipe!",2008-01-22
226218,821901,5,1,This recipe is amazing... My guests loved it. Super easy to make and very tasty! I will be making this again. Thank You!,2008-07-23

226218,608544,5,1,"This is the easiest and best paella recipe I've found.  I use Mahatma Saffron Yellow Seasonings Long grain Rice packet plus some regular white long grain rice to equal 1 1/2 cups.  This way I can omit the expensive saffron threads. I then omit the salt, because Mahatma puts plenty of salt in their packets.  I use low sodium chicken broth and a shredded rotisserie chicken.  I omit the sausage (just personal preference).  Thank you for posting this recipe!!",2009-01-04
226218,370903,5,1,"Thanks for this recipe. It was very simple and very delicious. 
I made a few changes, for example used andouille sausage, deglazed the pot after frying the onions with dry white wine, and used red pepper flakes.
Do not omit the saffron, it is the secret ingredient. You can get it a decent price at Indian grocery stores or Trader Joes.",2009-03-07
226218,1224926,5,1,"Yummy Yummy Yummy! This is my first time cooking paella and it was a total success. I used 2 spicy chorizo links instead of the 1 link suggested. I also used Vigo yellow rice with saffron so I didn't need to buy the threads. The rice took a little longer to cook, but just stay patient! My husband took the leftovers to work the next day and all of his colleagues wanted the recipe! Thanks for posting.",2009-04-22
226218,393305,5,1,"YUM!! Thank you very much for this delicious recipe. I was looking for a paella recipe to honour the memory of a great friend who cooked this for us, adding tonnes of love. I can't tell you how much it means that 'I got it right' first go, and on her birthday too...
I made the recipe exactly as described and it was perfect - we had nine people for dinner and all raved about it. Thank You!",2009-06-03
226218,740470,5,1,"Hate it when people change recipes but I had to make due with what I had. Used chicken breast cut in about 1 inch chunks and slightly cooked (no pink outside) during the initial browning. Followed recipe exactly but substituted about 1/2 bag of fresh baby spinach, chopped, for the asparagus. Will make again for sure. Thank you for a good recipe that was relatively easy to make.",2009-07-10
226218,493093,2,0,"Don't make this without a trial run. Cooked this in the oven an extra 5 min. since the shrimp weren't done. Some of the arborio rice came out overcooked and mushy, while some was undercooked and chalky. Next time I'll make it entirely on the stove so it can be stirred frequently and tested.",2009-10-28
226218,415934,5,1,"This was very nice.  I'd never made paella before (or tasted it, to be truthful) and I'd never cooked with saffron but I splurged on some and this looked like a good recipe to try out.  My husband wasn't sold on the saffron taste -- said it was a bit bitter for him -- but that it mellowed down in the leftovers the next day.  Personally I loved the saffron taste.

I did make a couple changes.  Since we don't eat pork, I used some turkey hot italian sausage links and I cooked the paella completely on the stove top because I had bread baking in the oven.  

I don't like bell peppers but since the red would look nice and I know my husband likes them, I put them in.  They really added a nice taste and I'm glad I used them (but if you tell anyone I said that about bell peppers, I'll deny it.)

This is definitely a keeper.",2009-11-25
226218,552055,5,1,My family really enjoyed this recipe. I did make some alterations based on the ingredients I had on hand. I did not have saffron and I used italian sausage and it still came out great. Also used smoked paprika instead of sweet. I will def make this again.,2010-01-19
226218,619970,4,1,"This is an excellent dish.  I've made it three times now; once as the serving for six and twice for larger parties where I had to transfer to large casserole pan because of tripling the recipe.  Here is something I don't understand but noticed the first time I made this and corrected the cooking time:  the uncooked arborio rice requires far more cooking time than 16 minutes (10 minutes plus the 5 after adding shrimp).  No one else seemed to have this noticed so what have I missed?  After adding the rice, I cooked for 3-4 minutes (vs 1 minute), then added 1 cup of chicken stock and cooked until it was absorbed before adding last 2 cups, combining with meat and transferring to the oven.  I then found I had to cook for 20 minutes vs 10 for the rest of stock to be absorbed and the rice softened.  I would also use 1/2 teaspoon of saffron for 6 serving size.",2010-03-08
226218,140132,5,1,"This is so good.  I made this last night for my family and we enjoyed this very much.  I made this in an extra large cast iron skillet.  I didn't have the chicken thighs so I used breasts.  I also couldn't find saffron :( , but I'm on the lookout for next time.  (I'm thinking I will order online)  We loved this.  Even with the changes this was a great dish.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us.",2010-03-30
226218,337952,5,1,"WOW - this was simply fantastic. After toting my large paella pan back from Spain (5 years ago!), I never used it :(.  I was extremely excited to make an authentic paella in it.  With my only sub being chicken breast and no aparagus, I did everything else.  It was really easy to prepare and cook.  I did have to bake it a bit longer than 10 min - more like 20-30min.  My husband and I devoured this through the whole week. I'm making it again today and will definitely have to freeze some for a FFY night. Thanks!",2010-07-06
226218,1506604,5,1,"YUM!! I replaced the sausage with keilbasa and omitted the asparagus bc I didn't have any and the peas bc I dislike them. So I bumped up the other veggies (the peppers, onions, and tomatoes) and it came out great. Instead of putting the pan in the oven I switched the food to a oven safe dish and threw in the shrimp in the middle. It needed a little longer than the directed time for all the broth to cook through but when it was done, it was the prettiest and most colorful dish. The shrimp didn't even overcook. I also replaced the saffron (which I cannot find anywhere) with tumeric and it was still awesome. This will definitely be a repeat offender in my house!",2010-11-01
226218,1299931,4,1,"Overall a good recipe, but clearly off in regards to cooking times and methods.  I have made it twice, the second time with some substitutions and adjustments just based on my own experience, personal taste and what I had on hand.

226218,695273,0,0,saffron is up to about $19 for 1/4 oz.  You can use yellow saffron rice if you can find. it anymore - not as good but better than none  because without it is not paella.,2013-02-27
226218,1800107892,4,1,I love this recipe but the cooking times seem a little off.  I usually add some crab to my paella too. &lt;br/&gt;www.paellapansuk.co.uk,2013-10-07
226218,1355867,5,1,Loved this recipe! I only tweaked the ingredients -- doubled the chourico for a bit more spice and used chicken drummettes instead of thighs. I also cooked it on stove top. Flavors blend well and was even better the day after!!,2014-01-22
448507,498271,5,1,"What a great bread!  Nice texture and the apple flavor is subtle and great with the cinnamon.  I made this in a mixer, let the dough rise for 1 hour, shaped a loaf and let that rise for 1 hour, then baked at 350 for 35 minutes.  Wonderful plain, toasted with butter, and made into French toast - thanks for sharing the recipe!",2013-05-20
131701,180898,5,1,"I made a few changes so not sure how close to the origional this was but its really really good. No leftovers and there were only 2 of us lol oink. First off, I didn't know where to get the greek yogurt around here so I used sour cream since both DH and I love it so much. I didn't cook the garlic, I chopped 2 cloves. 1 I mixed in with the sour cream and the other got cooked with the meat and onion. Since one clove wasn't cooked this was plenty for us. I also added the paprika (more than called for but I didn't measure) in to the meat. I added a little dill with the sour cream as well. I didn't use the butter or the chili pepper at all. I used egg noodles and when they were done I drained and tossed them in the pan with the meat and then scooped the yogurt mixture in and mixed it all together. I also added a squeeze of lemon (about 1/4 of a whole lemon)over the top and think this really brought all the flavors together. Served it with a wedge of lettuce drizzeled with a little lemon juice and EVOO. Even tho I changed this alot I feel it deserves 5 stars since it was this recipe that I started with. SO, thanks for a great recipe. We loved it and will be making it often. It didn't hurt that it was easy to make too. ",2006-05-25

I followed the recipe pretty exactly, though I had to use a couple of red onions along with the white as I didn't have enough left - 4 onions seemed a lot, but in fact was just right. Easy & quick to make. Will definitely do this again, I loved it & husband has requested it, thank you!",2007-11-25
131701,593927,5,1,"Really good and DH loved it. I used lean ground beef to which I omitted the chili pepper and added some Recipe #79179 as well as a little chopped fresh parsley and mint near the end of cooking. Being lean it got a bit dry, would use some oil next time. To the yogurt mixture I also added a small bit of the chopped mint, fresh lemon juice and grated English cucumber. Though I could leave the cucumber out and it would be good too. I just put butter on the pasta, as I didn't have paprika or cayenne.",2009-03-13
131701,1214599,5,1,"Loved this recipe - was very easy. I left out the chili pepper and just added some more cayenne. As a nursing Mom, I can't eat tomatoes, so this is a great creamy beef/pasta recipe alternative! Will make it again.",2009-03-24

312376,502302,4,1,I did make a few changes to the recipe but decided to give it stars anyways since no one else has reviewed this. I always steam my broccoli (in the microwave) but not squash because that just sounds tasteless... so I sauteed the squash. I only used one squash since it seemed larger than the ones called for. I reduced the oil/butter/lemon to one Tbs each and was happy with that. Also the thought of just tossing in raw garlic was unappealing so I sauteed the garlic for a little while with the other seasonings in the pan with the squash.,2011-11-14
340286,1833965,5,1,A very pleasant blend of flavours and easy to put together.  The only thing I might do differently would be to increase the amount of sauce--but I like a lot of sauce with my stir fries.  I also enjoy spicy... so at a minimum I will increase the chili paste next time.  Thanks!,2011-03-23

I had to keep mine in the oven for nearly 45 minutes however - and as you can see from the photo, they were cut thin.

I didn't use the rosemary, but added oregano and fresh chives instead. I only had time to marinade for 2 hours but even in that time the falvours came through the steaks.
The family loved the added flavour and enjoyed the steaks very much.  Wiith beef this marinade impressed my family!
Thanks Sharon. Next time I must try with lamb chops and marinade a little longer.",2010-03-09

237542,390859,4,1,"The recipe was good. As it is written it is difficult to follow so I am not surprised it received a ""no star"" rating.  Although buttermilk is listed in the ingredients, it never says to add it in the directions.  I added it after step #1 and continued to mix it.  It also doesn't specify how long to cook.  I just kept checking it to make sure it didn't get too brown.  It did taste good though.",2007-09-24
237542,676820,5,1,"I love a challenge. Actually, I made this because ofthe reviews :)  I added the buttermilk alternating it with the flour. Was very careful not to overmix it because THAT CAUSES IT TO NOT BAKE IN THE MIDDLE. I heated my oven to 350 and baked for abut 35-40 minutes (only because I personally like a darker crust). It was great! Good recipe wildflower, I'm keeping this one to make again.",2008-07-01
237542,1535,3,0,"I was really disappointed with this recipe. I bake often so I figured the lack of instructions others mention wouldn't be too much of a challenge. Like another reviewer, I added the buttermilk alternately with the dry ingredients. The problem came when I tried to decide when to remove it from the oven. It looked ""right"" but the center was still testing too doughy. By the time the middle tested done, the bread was rather dark and definitely too dry. I wonder if this would be better baked in a 9-inch square pan rather than a loaf pan. Another review mentions over mixing can cause it to not bake in the middle, but I don't think I did over mix it. I used homemade cherry jam instead of blueberry. The family ate it, but everyone agreed the cake didn't have much flavor and it was extremely dry. I doubt I'll bother making it again.

35277,693345,5,1,"If you read my profile, you will learn that raw celery and I have a hate/hate relationship, and it's pretty much been that way since I was in preschool. Why the 5 stars, you ask? Well, I give this 5 stars because of the creative ways my mom tried to get me to actually EAT it. She would dance the celery around about 1 inch above the table like it had invisible legs of a millipede - part of a non-existent conga line of other vegetables - all the while telling me how yummy it would be and humming some made-up tune. Also, once someone actually persuaded me to try this (probably some boy I had a crush on in kindergarten), it's actually not bad...however, for ME to like this, I have to put SO MUCH peanut butter on it that it really doesn't taste anything like celery anymore.

They would also be great as a side for steaks and grilled chicken.  I followed recipe first time exactly, except for I used a mixture of sweet potatoes and yams to give a nice variety of color.

Because I had put them in the fridge to thaw out yesterday, there was a good bit of liquid accumulated with them.  I used that liquid instead of adding any water.  I used Splenda brown sugar.  And I realized afterwards that I forgot to add any butter, and we didn't miss it at all!

The only changed I made was I used sour cream instead of cream and I choose elbow pasta.  It states serves 2 but we could of easily serve 4.

I served the vinaigrette on its own, for everyone to try with their cold chicken and salad. One by one everyone put a little on their salad, tasted it and then went back for some to pour over their cold chicken. My DS described it as a tangy honey mustard dressing. It was not overly sweet and was just right. A wonderful recipe loved and requested to be made again for this family.

The beans tasted a lot like the restaurants, but the sauce was a little too mild.  Next time I will add some more horseradish or something.  It didn't give that nose burning sensation that TGI's has!  Other than that, though, great recipe!  Thank you!",2008-04-04
191793,382071,5,1,"YUM YUM...GREAT snacking food while watching a movie. I made the dip as stated with 1% milk. I tried making the green beans healthier and think they turned out very good. I microwaved the beans in their bag for 4 minutes then put in cold water. I mixed twice the amount of spices with whole wheat flour and again with whole wheat panko bread crumbs. After coating the beans, I put them on a spray oiled cookie sheet and spray oiled the tops of them and baked them at 400F for 20 minutes. While the panko bread crumbs didn't completely coat them they were nice and crunchy. Coating each bean did take awhile but I think a kid might enjoy doing it.

useing the classic Hidden valley ranch packet mixed as directed. instead of the bottled stuff. not adding the vinegar. and doubleing the cayenne. this way tastes so much closer to the TGIF orriginal.

191793,623399,4,1,I was really excited to make these. The green beans are close to how Fridays makes them but I still think there needs to be some tweaking to the recipe.  The wasabi sauce didnt taste like what Fridays serves.  It just tasted like a kicked up ranch.  It didnt ever thicken up in the fridge and it stayed runny for me.  It was still good tho.  I also got this recipe from top secret recipes and I would say Id give this 3 stars for authenticity and 4 stars for being a good fried green bean recipe.,2008-10-14
191793,678524,5,1,I just made the Beer -battered Green Bean Fries (recipe somewhere on Google) today since it was easier (ingredients availability & time) to make. It was really good too! Almost taste the same as TGI's. I just used regular Ranch dressing for dip (mixed w/ 2 tsp of lemon juice).

191793,1925885,5,1,"As written, I would give it a four.  With a few tweaks though, this is definitely a five-star recipe.  We're not able to get ranch dressing mix here, so I just used natilla, which is a cross between creme fraiche and sour cream.  I also upped the wasabi (prepared, not powdered) and the horseradish because we like that nasal sting.  LOL!  We did NOT cook the green beans for 15 minutes, but rather until barely tender, no more than 5 minutes - so that they would hold upright and not wilt over.<br/>  <br/>The BIG SECRET though, is in double dipping.  I followed instructions for prepping the beans and the first few turned out just ok.  A bit ugly.  So I took the previously breaded beans (not fried yet), dipped them once again in the egg mixture, then again in the breadcrumbs and VOILA - the perfectly coated and crispy green bean!  Very much like I remember those at TGI Fridays.  Made for Help a Naked Recipe 2012.  Thanks for posting!!!",2012-09-26

After adding the potatoes and the sauce packet, a smaller amount of water was used (just a little over 2 cups).

I use the analogy of ""eating a beautifully decorated birthday cake"", that usually encourages people to dig in and enjoy. I was in a bit of a rush when I made this, so I made a quick sub of half of an onion as a base for the turkey, which worked out well. I also added a piece of sun dried tomato on the top of ""Tom's"" head for something of a ""turkey mohawk"" they seem to have. That seemed to give him a more ""finished"" look, lol.

I added 2 cloves for the eyes (since I could poke them in) and a tiny square of red bell pepper for the waddle (held in by a piece of toothpick).  I also used a small piece of red bell pepper for the feet.  I prepared all the veggies ahead of time and placed them in separate bowls.  The morning of our feast, I pulled out the bowls one by one and let my boys (ages 3 & 7) lay out the ""plumes.""  They loved getting to help.  I also placed crackers in front of the turkey as the ""ground.""  This was beautiful, fun to make, and delicious!",2009-11-29

I took pictures to show everyone in case it didn&#039;t survive it&#039;s time in the fridge.  Good thing I did because while in was in the fridge the dip kind of &quot;melted&quot; off the bowl and so it wasn&#039;t looking to great by lunchtime.  We all enjoyed it though and I would like to try it again as it really is a gorgeous idea.  Maybe the bowl I used was too slippery and a different bowl would work.

Here&#039;s the best hint I have to add: cover the bottom of the roasting pan wih very coarsely cut root vegetables (I use onion, carrot and celery) to catch the drippings and avoid the dreaded smoke and fire from the drippings.

The great part is that you can get the kitchen cleaned up while it's baking! It only took 15 minutes for it to be golden brown on top in my oven.

I started using butter flavored shortening when it came on the market, that is the only thing I do not like the orginal recipe .   Years ago when this first came out we all used LARD ~ YUCK NOW ! ! !   My grandmother first gave this recipe to me, so it's been around for at least 100 years .   Not on this subject, but a little vinegar in your beans really helps the taste .   grandma was always right . . .",2007-11-18

Mine is 20 cups flour, 10 cups shortening, 8 eggs, 8T vinegar and up to 8 cups of water.  Makes 12-13 2 crust pies and always comes out fabulous!!

I used it for individual chicken pies and finished it with an egg wash of 1 egg with a little heavy cream.  Simply superb.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for posting.  I have made egg crusts in the past but they were not as velvety as this one, this is commercial grade.",2011-02-20

79943,881125,0,0,"Clearly mistakes were made.  But I&#039;m unclear on what they were.  I measured 360 g of flour which is about 3 cups.  And added 12 oz of fat--though I only had 8 ounces of lard and used 4 of butter.  I couldn&#039;t find my pastry blender so I used knife and fork and cut the butter and flour together.  It seemed like way too much fat for the amount of flour.  I don&#039;t know if my scale failed massively (though I don&#039;t think so) or what.  I added a little extra flour.  I used the smallest egg I had.  I only added two tablespoons of ice water.  I turned down my AC.  I kept returning everything to the fridge.  And then, when I looked in the oven, the crust had slumped down the side of the pie plate to a greasy puddle in the middle of the pan.  I&#039;ve never made a perfect, beautiful crust, but this was my greatest failure by miles.  I&#039;m not using stars.  It is impossible that this is the recipe&#039;s fault given everyone else&#039;s raves.  But I&#039;m just posting in case someone else has the same experience.

The second time I tried to make these I added a little egg white like suggested by another who had tried this and that helped them stay together better, but the taste was still sort of bitter, I don't know if it was overly salty (I like things salty), they just didn't taste good.  It was a good idea, but for me I did not like the outcome.",2010-02-28
361412,1424975,4,1,"It could use more chocolate flavor and a bit more flour for thickening. Also, the recipe doesn't yield enough batter for an 8X8 pan and does not rise very much.
I would recommend adding one Tbsp of cocoa powder (and associated sweetener) and then doubling everything. I was surprised that the applesauce flavor baked out, because it was prominent before going into the oven. 
I have many dietary restrictions at the moment, so this recipe was perfect (with some egg substitute). I also added some peanut butter (a large spoon dollop) and used Agave nectar, which is less bitter than stevia. If you like a sweeter brownie, you might want to add a bit more sweetener as well, but I'm not sure how sweet it is with the stevia.

361412,1458294,3,0,"This was pretty good. The texture was excellent and it smelled fantastic, but recipe calls for too much baking soda. I used plain yogurt instead of applesauce, skipped the cinnamon, and added a bit more cocoa and whole wheat flour. I also used about 1.25 tsp of stevia powder (instead of liquid stevia), but it could have been sweeter. I topped this with some honey and enjoyed it very much. I would definitely make this again (just reduce the baking soda and add more stevia). Thanks a lot for the great recipe!",2010-08-11

201070,249591,5,1,"I loved this but made a few modifications.  I added one can of yellow corn to the mix.  I did not use the onion because the picante sauce had enough on its own.  I was unable to find cumin in my store so I used Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning blend instead.  I seasoned the chicken with it.  This took the place of the chili powder, cumin and oregano.  I did heat all the ingredients in a skillet but then layered it in a casserole dish with the cheese and chips and baked it at 350 for about 30 minutes or until cheese is melted. Yummy!

161250,227978,3,0,"I guess I let the winning status of this recipe build my anticipation, because frankly, I was disappointed.  It was only OK in my opinion, but certainly not worth a million dollars.  I thought maybe I did something wrong, so I visited the Pillsbury site to see if I had missed something.  And the average of the 100 Pillsbury reviews give this recipe only 2 1/2 stars (out of 5).  So I don't think I'm too far off regarding my opinion.  As for my specific comments, I think the maple syrup ovepowered the sauce.   So If I make this again, I think next time I will probably reduce the amount of syrup to 2 portions (not 3) and focus on the peach preserves for flavoring and thickening up the sauce.  And I (and my husband) thought the spinach stuffing smelled and tasted too similar to our regular Thanksgiving stuffing.  (Maybe it just us...but it just didn't seem right to be eating Thanksgiving stuffing when it isn't even Thanksgiving!)  So I would omit (or at least reduce) the sage and poultry seasoning, and maybe replace it with garlic salt and basil or something else that would flavor it nicley but not have it smell and taste so similar to our Thanksgiving stuffing.  But on the positive side....it''s a very easy recipe to make, and you end up with a nice roasted chicken breast and a good side dish.  All you have to do is add a buttered dinner roll or sliced garlic bread, and you have a complete meal.  And it was a great way to get my kids to eat spinach.",2008-07-19

I scooped them out as directed with a 1/4 cup but left them in mounds since it didn't say to flatten them...They didn't spread at all so they didn't need 4 inches between them.

Tasted great with and without the cream--I actually used half 'n' half, which I added to the pot before serving, not as a garnish, since this was a large church event.  I also used barley instead of irish (steel-cut) oatmeal.  Just didn't have time to find some.

As Nana Lee says though these will stick to the parchment paper if left too long but you do need to let them firm up for a couple of minutes.  Do not try to do this recipe without parchment paper!

This was good, probably even better with a nice ripe sweet melon (mine was only so-so to start with).

I used a small amound of jalapeno instead of the serrano, and the pepper with the ginger gave it a nice bite.  Would be nice in summer.

I did not care for the mint shreds mixed into the melon, and the sauce tasted better fresh than after cooking and cooling (personal preference, I think it had more POW).

Will certainly make again, the next time I have honeydew melon to use up, or perhaps for a light addition to summer grilled meal.  Thank you Gastronomic Foodie!",2007-01-17

I did however, add it to the turkey after stuffing it ;) I normally do not like to stuff a bird because of my fears of contamination, but I am alive today to make the report, so I think it was fine. I loved adding the bacon to it, it added such a great flavor to the whole thing and a richness to the gravy as the drippings made their way to the pan.

57772,357987,5,1,"I made these pretty much as stated.  I did substitue 1 lb of ground venison for the beef that needed to be used up.  I like to add it to things that are very flavorful, because although healthy I am not a big fan of the taste of venison.  These Mexican Shells were easy and tasted better than expected!  I thought they were excellent.  I froze them after making them and pulled them out for an easy night in the kitchen.  The combination of spices and texture was very pleasing and disguised the venison very well, while not overpowering the dish. 

Thanks for an easy and very tasty dish!",2007-10-05

I added a can of pink beans and a can of corn to mine because I'd used a seasoning that was much too spicy and I needed to spread it out.

I don't know if I just had a really big onion or what, but I ended up only using about 2/3 of the onion and that was plenty. I also used a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and thought it was just right. I'm not sure how much chili powder I used, but it added an awesome flavor to this dish.
Next time I'll make more and freeze them. Thanks Pamela for an awesome recipe!:D",2007-11-02

I think flavors need to mellow a bit and when they do boy is this addicting!",2007-12-01

Was EXACTLY what wanted to eat too!

Terrific! Will be making again soon, TRUE!",2008-03-02
57772,795588,3,0,"I made this recipe exactly as written with no deviations. I hate to do this with all the fabulous reviews, but hubby did not care for this dish. It was not as well seasoned as one would expect and it was on the border of being dry. Maybe it would be better if it were made and eaten fresh as opposed to made, frozen and then heated later? I would be curious to know how many raters made this recipe and ate it fresh - vs - frozen and reheated. I would make this recipe again, however, I would eat fresh and I would adjust the seasonings.",2008-03-25

57772,283834,4,1,This dish had awesome flavor! I agree with the previous reviewer that it's a little more work intensive to put together in the shells and I was thinking about also making it a mexican lasagna or with macaroni. I highly recommend it though because the flavors are incredible and it's a nice break from a standard mexican meal. Thanks!,2008-08-14
57772,507422,5,1,This was amazing!  Even my two incredibly picky eaters couldn't wait to try it and they loved it.  They even ate the leftovers.  I used manicotti instead of shells and ended up making a batch like a lasagna.  Stuffing just seemed rather time intensive.  It was yummy nonetheless.,2008-09-13

I made a few modifications - substituted ground turkey for the beef, only used 1/2 an onion, and added 1 cup of refried beans to the meat mixture.  I cooked half of the shells and froze the others.  Looking forward to having this again.  Yummers!",2008-09-14

57772,804263,5,1,GREAT!!!!! I made my shells with diced chicken and sauteed a vidalia onion.  I also used more salsa instead of using tomato sauce.  Very tastey meal....there was not a single one left!  Will definitely make this again and again:).,2008-09-21

57772,48612,5,1,"Really great!  We did this as an OAMC recipe, and it was excellent.  I don't know if maybe my shells weren't big enough or what, but this made a *lot* of shells.  We sort of had mexican stuffed shell casserole by the end of it, but the flavor was amazing.  I added crushed red pepper to the portion on my plate just to kick it up a notch.  Yum!",2008-10-17
57772,376098,4,1,"We enjoyed this.  For some reason ours ended up a bit on the salty side, so next time I need to use lower-salt taco seasoning or check the sauce and make sure it's low salt.  Other than that, we thought this was great, and we have the other half in the freezer waiting for a busy day.  Thanks for the recipe!",2008-10-18
57772,252727,4,1,"I think my pan was too big for the amount of the shells, so they were a little on a dry side when I took them out of the oven. Also found out that they were a little too salty, probably because of the type of seasoning (I used store-bought) and salsa. Next time I'll make my own seasoning (as suggested!) to avoid extra salt and sodium.",2008-10-30
57772,15913,5,1,"Five stars because my husband judged this recipe a ""keeper"" -- and he's a picky eater. Couple of notes: I added just a bit of sugar to the sauce mixture because straight tomato sauce is too acidic for us. Also, I live at high altitude, and the baking instructions didn't work for me. I wound up baking for approximately 40 minutes at 400 degrees to get the shells warmed thru. All that said, this dish is truly delicious and a snap to make! I threw a bunch of these in the freezer for future use. Thanks for sharing!",2008-11-02

57772,292308,4,1,"These lend themselves well to improvisation.  I had no tomato sauce so I just used salsa.  I put a cube of pepper jack and cheddar on each shell and covered the whole thing with shredded mozzarella that I had in the fridge.  I think cheese in the beef mixture would be a plus (it was slightly dry after baking) and maybe cover it with foil and cook through (my noodles got a little tough around the edges).  Then top with cheese until it melts.  Sliced avocados complemented it well.  DH suggested shredded lettuce and extra salsa.  We enjoyed.  Wasn't was timed consuming as I thought, though it did dirty up 3 dishes to make this one thing...something I try to avoid. :)",2008-11-19

Spicy but not too hot.  This is a keeper Pamela!",2008-12-20

57772,227989,3,0,"For some reason, my shells weren't as super as the other posts raved.  :-(  I used ground turkey as we don't eat much red meat and maybe that was the difference.

57772,1355623,5,1,"I made this last night for my family and they loved it - definitely a ""do again.""  I changed a couple of things to add more flavor -- after browning my beef and onions together I added 3 cloves of garlic, taco seasoning (recipe #4292 - much better than packet taco seasoning); increased the water to 3/4 cups (maybe a little more),  increased the salsa to probably 1 cup+ of my homemade salsa.  I did not measure my shredded cheese (I used Mont. Jack/Cheddar) but I am sure it was more than the recipe called for. I let everything simmer for approx. 10+ minutes -- so flavors could mix together and thicken.  When making my tomato sauce I used a pint of my homemade salsa and 1/4 teas. of chili powder for flavor.  Proceeded to fill my shells after spreading a thin layer of sauce in 9x13 pan.  After pouring remaining sauce over the shells I topped it with a few jalapenos, added my cheese (I just sprinkled the cheese on top, not sure how much). I cooked it for 45+ minutes and let it stand for 5 - 10 minutes before serving.  Each serving was topped with a small amount of sour cream and spanish rice was served on the side.  Definitely a ""do again!""  Prep time is definitely more than 15 minutes -- but that was fine with me.  Serves 6-8 adults.  It was filled with calories, but ohhh so good!",2009-10-14
57772,685726,0,0,"Following some suggestions from other members, I added a can of black beans & minced chiles along with some chopped black olives.

added: I just made these again. Was out of salsa and wasn't able to get to the store. I added some of the taco seasoning to the tomato sauce and added some chopped tomatoes. Turned out wonderful!!! I have a few pans of these in the freezer for later. This is always a great dinner!!!",2010-01-25

I made 16 shells, but I had enough filling that I could've easily filled 18. I used a packet of low-sodium taco seasoning, 1/2 tsp chili powder, and 2 (15 oz.) cans of tomato sauce. I might only use 1 can of tomato sauce, or maybe 1 (15 oz.) can and 1 (8 oz.) can next time, because there was a TON of sauce. One more thing.. I used more cheese then called for (colby jack with chopped habenero, jalapeno, and chipotle chilies in it from Sam's Club). My father-in-law said I should definitely make it again, and I agree.

I boiled one whole box of big shells and not limit myself to what the original recipe called for.  Then I started to make the sauce and thought, Oh no I'm not going to have enough...I did add some cream cheese and like two different kinds of cheese to the sauce and boy was it delicious!  All in All it made a huge batch in a 9 x 13 casserole pan and even had to double layer it.  With great results I might add!  Very easy to prepare!  My kids loved it and so did I!

I also added a lot of salt, and would add even more next time. I actually baked the whole thing at once, and just froze the leftovers, that way all i have to do when we have them next time is thaw then heat them up a bit.

Having grown up with best friends from Thailand, I ate this daily and learned to make this the traditional way of the Thai people. 
It best to have large mortar and pestle.  Then the only things I do suggest is that for the most part, Som Tom is made with pickled mud fish sauce or shrimp paste versus the fish sauce.  Also, we usually use cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes.  We normally leave out the cashews.  This is very good recipe though.  Like all recipes, there are as many versions of Som Tom as there are soups!  Many times you can use mango or cucumber or even carrots instead of Papaya!  One of my all time favorites!!

465994,28177,3,0,"This makes a nice icing, the cranberry flavor is really refreshing, but it's not a good decorator frosting.  To achieve a decorator consistency I added a lot of extra powdered sugar.  By the time I could swirl a cupcake it was too sweet to eat more than a couple bites, and the frosting wouldn't stay upright without immediate freezing, which I did for the photo.  I know this recipe has serious potential and I will most definitely play around with it until I can use it for decorating.  The color changes from a bright burgundy to a dark mauve and eventually (with more sugar) a pale mauve with bright red specks of cranberry.  It would be a really lovely color on a wedding cake.  Even though we can't eat this frosting, it didn't go to waste.  I'm teaching my 5 year old daughter to decorate and this was a perfect opportunity to just let her go to town practicing her cupcake swirls.

The results were lovely though...a soft,airy,slightly sweet roll that smelt just delicious.

I made these buns yesterday, 11/26/09.
Waited patiently for the buns to complete baking.  Just had to try a hot, right out of the oven bun, along with lots of butter.  I was absolutely delighted with the lightness and texture.  Had one bun for breakfast with butter, peanut butter and honey, and a cup of coffee, Wowee, absolutely scrumptous.
I followed your recipe exactly.  The first 2 hour rise was perfect. Divided the dough into 16 buns (2.9 ounces each), place them on a cookie sheet just touching each other, covered and let them rise for 1 hour, then baked for 25 minutes and they were a beautiful light golden brown.

I add 0.5c more but I will not adding more and more fluor as it will make the buns heavier. Maybe next time I will reduce water to 1c only. And I use lemon juice instead of vinegar. In my opinion, vinegar was too strong, so I can taste it in the buns. But still, I can taste really slight tang, by using the lemon. Overall, nice idea to use vinegar as a booster.",2011-05-19

I don't even think I ended up using all the three cups of flour and once the dough seemed mixed enough I just rolled it into a ball and let it rise in a lightly greased bowl for almost 3 hours ( because I forgot took a nap) And made sure to cover it with a damp tea towel while it was rising. I got nervous about how sticky the dough was when I tried to make my buns but I greased my fingers a bit and roll 8 largish rolls.

111630,122235,4,1,"These were very nice pancakes & would be especially appropriate for a holiday brunch. I did find I needed to add about 1/4 cup extra milk to get them to the right thickness. Maybe that was because I used sour cream in place of the yogurt, as that was all I had. I did not have any candied ginger, but I'll bet that the ginger butter would be great!

I used frozen mixed berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries) and sprinkled them with a little sugar as they were unsweetened. I used raw whole Jersey milk and very rich cream for the milk and cream, and double strength vanilla. I was able to whip it up and bake it while preparing dinner, then I let it cool while we ate. After dinner, I spooned it up and topped with whipped cream. It was lovely! I did go a little heavy on the berries--I used most of a 6 oz bag instead of only 10 ozs--but I loved the fruitiness of the final product. DH enjoyed it very well, too.

That was their cover-up to ""Wow! they smell so good."" and ""We might not get to try Mom's dessert"".  I love the fact that the custard isn't very sweet so the raspberry taste really shines through. The only issue I had is the custard tended to weep a little around the raspberries, so next time I will try omitting some of the raspberry syrup to see if that resolves the issue.

One note.  I did not need to boil the polenta for 20 minutes.  It was thickened and ready to spread into the pan after 8 minutes.  Also, just for fun I cut my polenta into cookie cutter shapes rather than diamonds.  Polenta is exceptionally amenable to cookie cutters and I had the cutest polenta ""pumpkins"".

The confectioners sugar also contrasts well with the burnished flavor of the doughnuts' outer layer.

It's got a little heat but that can all be controlled to suit individual tastes without sacrificing the overall enjoyment.  The recipe looks like a lot of ingredients but it was actually very little work.  Most of my time was spent draining cans.  ;)  We loved the wide variety of beans & the addition of corn in this recipe, but the best part had to be the sweet & sassy chipotle aroma that filled the house during the 3 hours I had it simmering on the stove.  After the first bite, DS (15 yrs) claimed that it was his ""all-time favorite"" chili recipe.  I made 1/2 the recipe for 3 of us & a toddler & that gave us plenty for dinner & another dinner and a lunch vacuum packed & frozen for later.  This would be a perfect OAMC recipe.

Not sure if mine quite did that, other than sizzle.  Okay so anyway I had about 2 1/2 cups worth of mashed veg (roughly mashed since the veg I had weren't mushy-tender, just tender and they didn't mash up well).  I halved the cumin and chili flakes (used crushed red pepper for the chili flakes).  Heated oil on med-high, mixed in seasonings, added veg, forgot to stir the veg in the oil just shook the pan a bit to distribute the oil in along bottom of pan, smashed veg down and checked them every few minutes.  Full cook time for mine was about 10 mins on med-high and a few extra on medium.  This was browned nicely on the one side.  I am glad I halved the spices, cuz this was spicy!  I like medium heat and halving the spices was perfect for my tastes.  My veg were some broccoli, a little celery, onion, and mostly potatoes and carrots.  Yes I did cook these ahead of time on purpose to try this recipe. :D  I used chicken bouillon and water to make a broth to cook the veg in, cooled, strained, refrigerated a day or so before making this.

I like strong flavors, so I think I would play around with the spices to get more oomph out of it--probably coriander, garam masala, and other Indian flavors. EDIT:  The leftovers were great!  I smooshed them out thin and put under the broiler at 400 degrees, letting them get browned and crisp on top.  Then drizzled with a sweet hot chutney.  Yum!  Would make again!",2010-06-16

I emptied the tins, expecting that going back and incorporating the butter into the batter would turn this great smelling batter into hockey pucks.  But you can't loose when it's a Mean Chef recipe.

The muffins turned out light and moist.  They were great....cake-like.  In fact, they would be a great alternative to cupcakes with a light drizzle of glaze or even a frosting.  You'll never miss the extra sugar of a cupcake recipe.

The zest of the additional lemon was enough, although I may zest the lemon that the original 1/4 c of juice came from.  It will add a bit more of a lemony taste to these wonderful treats.

I could not find frozen or fresh cranberries.  I rinsed the sauce off of the cranberries and just used the whole berries.  They were not as whole and firm as fresh or frozen, but it worked very well.  DH and I had this for dessert tonite, but I don't think it should be saved for just dessert.  It would make a nice side dish for any meal.  It is quite a delicious and sneaky way to eat your veggies!  Thanks Pvt Amys Mom!   6/21/12  Thought I should update my review as I have made this many times now and my friends love that I share it with them.  I do make it according to the recipe, only sub is that I usually use dried cranberries as I keep them in my pantry to add to salads.  I don't take the time to shred the zucchini, I just chop it as fine as I can, leaving some larger pieces just for looks.  This always turns out moist and very very flavorful.

I tried this because its a homey dish I remember from childhood, and it didn't turn out like I'd hope, but it was still delicious. I didn't know exactly how long to cook the dumplings, so it turned into a waiting game. Once I got over my initial disappointment over the dumplings, I realized that it was rich and very well seasoned, just like my grandmother made it.

206111,338539,4,1,"This was really good.  Even my husband who is ""scared of"" tofu thought it was pretty good, though the texture was still a bit ""spongy"" for him.  We found that the sauce was pretty strongly flavored, but that it worked well with the loaf, which was not very strongly flavored (even with a whole packet of the onion soup mix).  My 14yo liked it, and my 6yo liked the loaf but not the sauce.  

I found some of the instructions confusing.  For example, the ingredients call for 1.5 Tbsp of garlic, which is an odd way to measure garlic, other than powder, which I assume wasn't intended, since it was to be sauteed with the onion.  I ended up using 3 cloves, and minced them, and added them to the onions after they were mostly done.    Also it was unclear whether the oil used in sauteeing the onions was to come out of the 1/4 cup of vegetable oil or not -- I didn't measure what I used to sautee, but then didn't fill my measuring cup right to the top when measuring the 1/4 cup later.  

Finally, I'll just add that it took me longer than advertised to make it.  The recipe includes 1 hour and 10 minutes of cook time, and it took me about 1/2 hour total prep time to do the chopping, sauteeing, measuring, mixing and placing into the loaf pan.

I loved the use of sage as a nice change from the usual basil or oregano - used about 1/2 teaspoon in all.  The polenta was a nice platform for the rustic character and flavor of the beans & tomatoes.  As you can see from my pictures, forgot to make the polenta in advanced and served it with the hot unformed polenta.

I have made this 3 times already (first 2 batches went quickly so I increased the amounts for the 3rd one :P) The last batch I made I used more wakame and capers than the previous versions -- this made it even better as I really love the flavour of the seaweeds and the capers add a nice tang/saltiness. For those who don't like too much salt you might want to decrease the tamari to 1 tsp or even omit it altogether as this can be quite salty. But I love salty things and besides, the flavours are very intense so you only need a little dab on whatever you are using it on. :) This is definitely a new favourite of mine. It looks pretty too.

Set it on my rapid bake cycle (I have a Hitachi -cycle is 2 1/2 hr cycle) It rose great and the flavor is pretty good! I did not have flax seed, but I used whole ground flax seed meal.   I served it with Rosemary Butter.  Delicious! I think I'll try adding Rosemary to the mix and try it that way.  Perhaps 1/2 tsp of dried rosemary should do.  On a side note.

Will experiment a little to see how best to get rid of the grainy effect - may use the stand mixer to mix instead of the stick blender and hopefully get a smoothier consistency and hopefully the melted chocolate will mix better as it can be poured in as it is being beaten.

309470,894789,5,1,"This was a terrific and fast way to prepare turkey.  I had some turkey tenderloins I'd purchased earlier in the week with no idea how I would prepare them.  So I popped on to RecipeZaar and found this great, quick idea.  

The only changes I made were to thoroughly season the tenderloins with Seasoned Salt and Seasoned Pepper before browning.  I think the Seasoned Pepper made a big difference as it added just a touch of heat that would otherwise have been missing.  If you don't have this item in your kitchen, get some; I keep it by the stove top along with regular salt, Seasoned Salt, and my pepper grinder and it is used frequently to ""zing"" up recipes that read a little flat.

After removing the tenderloins from the pan, I boiled the sauce for just a few minutes to reduce it and thicken up its consistency to a real glaze.  I made a pot of Jasmine rice in the rice cooker and steamed some broccoli while the tenderloins braised in the orange sauce for 15 minutes.  I wouldn't cook them longer than this; in fact, next time I'll likely check them at 12 minutes as I think they''ll be done, and tenderloins can overcook fast and then what you've got is the dry, white turkey meat you remember from your Mom's Thanksgiving Dinners.  

My family's only complaint was that they wanted MORE glaze--by the time I had reduced it to the right consistency, there was less of it than they wanted.  I'll probably fiddle with the proportions of marmalade, etc., next time so that we end up with more glaze.  

Overall, a great mid-week meal choice--I had everything on the table well under 30 minutes from when I started--you can't ask for more when everyone is starving and you are exhausted.",2008-08-23

77854,198593,5,1,"We enjoyed these at our Easter Brunch.  I used the ziploc bag method which made refilling the eggs a snap!  This is definately a new twist on the old-fashioned deviled egg recipe!  The only problem was that I didnt make enough, 24 didn't last long at all.",2005-03-28
77854,179232,5,1,"These were excellant. I usually just use mayo, mustard, vinegar & sugar with a bit of paprika but I decided to try something differant and I'm so glad I did. These dissapeared even faster than my normal recipe. I made these for my sons birthday party. Since it was a dinosaur theme I had a little fun. I boiled the eggs the day before, cracked them and then let them sit in colored water all night. They looked so neat. The children had a blast eating their dinosaur eggs and the adults had loved eating them as well. ",2005-06-10

After using my handheld blender to process the yolk filling, I used the tip  about using a baggie to fill them which made much less mess.

well not only are they good..they are EXCELLENT
I followed EXACTLY ..
EXCEPT I replaced the pepper with cayanne pepper..just enough to feel a little heat but not so much as to hurt the youngsters ( my little great niece & nephews love these)...
I think when I make deviled eggs from now on I'm doing it your way..(sorry mom)..but if mom were still alive I'm sure she would like these better also instead of our old fashioned just miracle whip with a dash of mustard..try these you will not be disappointed",2007-03-27

I used a couple of green onions and whirred through the mini food processor as Kittencal suggested, and I highly recommend this step. Besides being very easy, the filling was quite smooth and easy to stuff eggs. I'll make these again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!",2007-04-09

77854,271221,5,1,"This is by far the best recipe I have ever used. I would make an addition to reviewer Pierre Dance's suggestion regarding using a baggie to pipe the yolk mixture in the whites. No matter how you cut the egg whites the side with the yolk is always going to be messy especially if the eggs have been stored in the frig with the carton sitting flat on the bottom, which means the yolk will gravitate to the bottom on the shell and when they are cut length wise, the whites are too thin to really support the piped yolks. This can be overcome by storing the egg cartons in the frig for at least three days with the cartons standing on their sides. The yolks will settle evenly on the length of the shell. When the eggs are boiled and peeled use a iced-tea spoon to scoop out the yolk and a paring knife to trim all the thin, floppy pieces of the white. You will now have a beautiful whole egg to pipe instead of having two mutilated halves. Pipe the yolk mixture into the whole egg. You can make a beautiful centerpiece for Easter lunch by dividing the yolk mixture into four or five different baggies and dyeing each a different pastel color. Place these colored eggs in a large brandy-type sniffer glass, adding garden flowers around the base.",2007-10-17
77854,452940,2,0,"After looking at all the other reviews, perhaps I did something wrong? I felt they were too spiced up. We have tried so many deviled egg recipes, and it seems to us, that mayo and mustard, then sprinkled with paprika is the best. We love and use many of your recipes kittencal, and a few of your cookbooks we saved as favs. But sadly, I won't make this one again.",2007-10-19
77854,220166,5,1,"I have never made deviled eggs in my life!  I am not a big egg eater but I decided this Thanksgiving I was going to try them.  These were awesome and so easy to make.  I boiled 18 eggs the night before and put them in the frig till turkey day morn.  That morning I peeled the eggs sliced them in half and placed all the yolks in a gallon zipper bag along with the rest of the ingredients and just mixed in the bag.  I have to admit though I do not add the milk.  I added dill pickle relish (at the request of my mom) and didn't want the mixture to be too thin.  So when it came time for depositing the filling in the whites, I just snipped the corner of the bag and piped the yolk mixture in!  It was so east and the was virtually no clean up!  I loved the flavor because the filling wasn't sweet (I used mayo not miracle whip)and the dill stood out.  My sister made the standard Deviled Egg ( Miracle Whip and sweet relish) and mine disappeared way before hers!  And around my family, that is saying alot!!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!  I will make again!",2007-11-24

I'm used to the pickle relish kind, so these seemed a little milder.  I might up the spices a bit next time, but everyone said they were good.  I love the tip to use mini paper cup liners!  If I ever have to take them somewhere, I already have the liners.",2007-12-24

I made these for lunch, and we ate out instead, so I had them to eat on the second and third days.  They were definitely better after sitting that day.  

It had a very nice consistency, and although I love dill weed, I may end of leaving that out the next time altogether.",2007-12-26
77854,281399,5,1,"Awesome deviled eggs! Very good directions. I used Hellmans olive oil mayonnaise turned out wonderful, I omitted the milk.

77854,428885,5,1,Great yummy-delicious eggs! I made this exactly as specified and easy to put together. I mixed the egg yolks and all dry ingredients first in the ziploc and after all was mixed I placed this inside the fridge for about 2 hours. Before filling adding mayonnaise and milk. Snipped off the end and filled away. I then chilled for another hour and they were downed and gone by our friends working here on the farm. Perfect! Perfect! Will absolutely make these often!

Used chopped green onions and omitted the dill-didn't have any. Dusted w/ paprika just like Mom used to do! A tip I saw on foodnetwork was to place eggs on a bed of split peas (if you don't have an egg plate)-colorful presentation and the eggs don't roll around.

77854,79877,5,1,"Fantastic Eggs!  I can't add another thing except for another tip.  If you are taking these beauties to a pot luck or party, instead of slicing the eggs lengthwise, cut them in half in the middle.  Make the recipe as directed, and transport the eggs in the reserved egg cartons.  When you get to the event, you can then put the protected and perfect eggs on your platter, and they won't have slid all around with smushed tops.

I've been making deviled eggs...well since I was old enough to cook an egg, and this is our recipe, except that we use lemon juice (about a tablespoon) instead of the milk; makes the filling lighter-tasting, and as I've never been a fan of Miracle Whip, I use Best Foods Mayo -- the best.  As my husband cannot digest garlic, I've since substituted onion powder for the garlic powder, but that's just our issue.

77854,1243627,5,1,Very good deviled eggs. I added a touch of course mustard instead of the dried mustard. It adds a touch of spice and texture. I used the bad idea to mix and pipe and it turned out great. I will try Bill's idea next time of turning my egg cartons and using the whole egg.,2009-04-19

Thanks for the post.",2013-04-01
77854,805729,5,1,O my GOSH these were amazing! I used homemade mayonnaise (http://www.food.com/recipe/homemade-mayonnaise-71967) and substituted that mayo for the milk and otherwise made this as is. The eggs were from our backyard chickens (kept the eggs for about a week so I could peel them!) and these are hands down the absolute best deviled eggs I have had in my entire life. I'm taking them to a pot luck tomorrow and I know they're going to be a hit. The filling is so rich and full of flavor - really fantastic. Kittencal you are a food goddess - thank you for posting!

I added optional garlic and used seasoning salt, and I tasted them and thought maybe too overbearing (very critical of food I take to gatherings).

I also used freshly gathered eggs from our chickens, but I think the fresh eggs and great recipe were a hit.  Thanks kittencal again for a slam dunk keeper.

I didn't have either on hand when I set out to make some at Easter, so I went hunting for a recipe that didn't need them.

I did the half salad dressing/half mayonnaise combination.  I also used half and half since I had about two tablespoons left from the holidays.  Since I was only making a half-recipe, I boiled eight eggs and used the two extra yolks.  I think seven eggs would be plenty since I had some leftover filling.  The only deviation I made from the recipe is that I added a touch of hot sauce.  This recipe goes into my keeping file. Thanks for posting.",2013-01-05

77854,2000297847,1,0,"I am giving this recipe 1 star, even though it is a 3-star recipe, mostly to pull the rating down because it does not deserve the 4.9 rating at all -- for the several reasons that I will explain below:
1. These deviled eggs are simply average in overall profile, I followed this recipe exactly down to every 1/8 teaspoon
2. This recipe calls for too much salt
3. there is no explanation of what constitutes the &quot;salad dressing&quot; that could potentially replace the mayonnaise.  Is it Italian, Ranch, French?  Who knows?
4. Most importantly; A good deviled egg is mustard-forward without the mustard overpowering any of the other ingredients.  I had to quintuple the mustard to even taste it.  Which, then, overpowered the green onions which i double to provide some balance.
5. In closing, this is not the ultimate final deviled eggs recipe that it claims to be and has been reported and rated as such.

Suggested alternations; half the salt, 4-5x the mustard, add more of the green onions, dill, pepper, and paprika to taste (apx. 1/8 -1/4 teaspoon of each).  Also, you must thoroughly beat or whip the yolks and mixture to get the velvety/creamy texture you expect from a caterer/restaurant quality deviled egg, for the record.",2015-06-27

77854,2001612471,5,1,"7/4/17- Made this and used 2 doz extra large eggs. Yield was a 24 halves with 7 extra halves. I used the extra egg whites to make add to a tuna salad. You can use to make an egg salad too. These are the changes I made: 1. Sprinkled in a little powdered sugar to mimic using &frac12; Miracle Whip 2. Doubled the ingredients 3. Used Fresh Chive, Dill and parsley. Used the amounts for the dried, but next time I would use more chives. 4. Used only 1 tablespoon of the milk for the double recipe 5. Added a teaspoon of horseradish. 6. Garnished with a tiny sprig of dill on each egg half after dusting with paprika. 7. I used a dessert press with a large star setting to pipe the eggs. You could also just put in a plastic bag and cut a little tip of the corner off and pipe the eggs that way. I think it just makes them look better! :-) Next time I might experiment with some sweet relish and omit the powdered sugar. This was a great recipe and I put the eggs in my handy dandy deviled egg holder from Bed Bath Beyond. It is double layered with a cover with a carrying handle. Perfect for bringing to a party.

Example: ""mushroom, sliced or chopped"". It would have also been easier if the ingredient list was in order of the written recipe.

I didn't have sumaq, read somewhere that lemon rind and a little more salt is a good sub, which is what I did.  I also had to use dried mint - otherwise, as is.  The only thing I would do differently next time is not follow the package directions on the couscous so closely - it called for sauteeing the couscous in oil before adding boiling water - which was fine, but the amount of oil was too much...especially when you're adding a salad dressing to it later on.

This went together rather quickly once the couscous was cooked. I used  regular ol' cucumbers, scrubbed and stripe-peeled the skins, cut out the seeds and cubed the flesh .  I used currants instead of the raisins because I like them. I dry my own sumac in the fall, so I used that. It has a nice strong flavor, so I cut the quantity of lemon juice back some, and as an afterthought, added in a bit of  za'atar blend. The mint is up early this year, so I was able to pick it out of the yard. This salad kept really well,   I was just as happy with the flavor of it the following day - not that there was much of  it left.

In this salad I just used regular cucumbers because the English cucumbers were like 3.00 and I wasn't paying that and those are the only 2 cucumbers you get here. For the tomatoes I used Campari tomatoes, they have so much flavor. Tomatoes are just tastless here but those Campari ones are so good and bursting with flavor. Very quick to put this salad together. Couscous really didn't take that long to cook.  Got it all ready in the morning and kept in fridge till lunch time. Such a yummy flavor and very colorful. Will be making this one again many times.

I made this in a 2 serving size and sprinkled a measured tsp of Penzeys Southwest Seasoning onto the veggies and stirred well.

Next time, I would check it before the full hour because it was  a little more ""done"" than I like. There will definitely be a next time.

I also used half wheat germ and half ground flax so I would still get the benefit of flax. I also omitted the white sugar because of the sweetness from the banana, raisins and the brown sugar. It was plenty sweet. Last change, sorry for all the tweaks, I added 1 tsp. baking powder as the healthy ingredients used are fairly heavy so I thought it could use a bit more leavening. Adding the baking powder worked very well. This recipe is so delicious! It is a keeper in my family and one I'm proud to serve as breakfast. Thank you for posting it Eryn.",2008-03-21

150253,793359,5,1,By far the best turkey meatloaf recipe ever. I didn't change a thing. The taste of the meatloaf was full flavored and extremely good. I don't usually like ground turkey but I am trying to acquire a taste for it. If all of the recipes I have tried were this good I would already be a convert. This helps greatly. Thanks,2016-11-07

The loose tea I had on hand was Republic of Tea Blackberry Sage, and you could taste the subtle flavors in the sauce. I did double the sauce so we'd have extra to serve over the rice I substituted for the pasta. But the two of us easily polished off all the scallops, there's no way we could limit ourselves to 4oz each (although we may just be greedy when it comes to seafood). This was very, very good!

Per another review, I doubled the sauce which helped the noodles a lot.  The four of us finished them off, no problem; but I will probably not make any scallops again (until DD leaves for college)",2005-02-23

My grocery store erroneously listed the price of their sea scallops, and I just happened to be the first to fall into the trap and say something, my lucky day! I ended up with 2-2 lb. bags free! It's always a treat to find scallops with no added water. I'm so glad this came up first in my search on Zaar, so delicious! I'm a little embarrassed to say all I had was Red Rose tea bags, everything else was chai or some other flavor...I just poured it all right in there and the sauce,(which I doubled), without straining, was fab. I used fresh squeezed orange juice, which is always better than concentrate. The sauce was so sweet and tangy and was enough to soak the wide rice noodles to perfection. We love rice noodles, and it was great to find a recipe that called for them. Thank you for this recipe, I will be making it again, and will also use the sauce with other things. YUMMMMM!

61059,356296,5,1,"Very good and easy way to serve scallops, yet it looks impressive. Two things I would suggest. Start the scallops in a screaming hot pan to get a nice crusty sear on each side. Also, I just tossed a tea bag into the sauce (which I doubled) that way I didn't have to worry about the mess and the fuss of straining the sauce. Why work when you don't have to?",2008-11-24

Next time, and there will be many next times, I want to try the orange juice to see the difference. The pineapple juice and the rest of the spices were very subtle.Good thing I had a new knee high stocking to strain the solids out of the sauce. VERY Yummy!",2009-06-01
61059,268501,4,1,"Solidly great.  I would like to add another half star.  I used the cast iron pan and got it really hot before putting in the scallops.  I also cut down the honey by half.

In honor of the 1st of May I decided to make this to get ready for Cinco de Mayo, but only had boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Because of this, I'm sure it was not nearly as good as using wings and took longer to make.  Adding the lemon-lime soda was the thing that made this a step above other spicy wings.  I'd go easier on the sprinkled red pepper flakes next time (I didn't measure!) and would add the green onion halfway through the browning phase, so they wouldn't crisp up.  As a main course, we really liked putting some leftover sauce on the rice I made using chicken broth.

I used only 1/2 cup Sucanat instead of the sugar substitutes, I used regular (not lite) organic butter, I substituted the egg with flax (I have posted a recipe, Flax Vegan Egg Substitute, which isn't yet online- will post the recipe # once its up), used whole wheat pastry flour for the flour.  I would say the serving size is right on the money- I baked in an 8x8 pan and cut mine into 12 smallish bars and would consider 2 bars a serving.  Really filling like you said- I had 2 bars for breakfast and worked 5 hours without a break at work (retail at the moment at a *very busy* store) without feeling hungry or fatigued!  Very tasty!  Nice texture, too- they're chewy and a little crisp at the same time.  I think these would be a great snack to keep on-hand instead of the ultra processed candy-filled storebought granola bars.

450,29196,4,1,"I brought a big pot of water to the boil, and dealt with all the veggies seperately, dropping them in, bringing them back to the boil and then cooking for a minute or two before removing them with a slotted spoon. I also cut a carrot into ""flowers"". I served the sauce seperately, so a very health concious friend could use it or not!
We had pork satay, and I used the sauce from that for both dishes.",2002-08-12
450,851841,5,1,"My husband and I lived in Malaysia for 4 years and became WELL acquainted with the local food.  We loved Gado-Gado which is Indonesian but the Malay love it also and it is seen on many restaurant menus throughout the country.  Southeast Asians normally peel their cucumbers but since we hae returned to living in the states I DON'T, not only because of the nutrient value, but also it adds color to the salad.  I also add shredded carrots to the salad for the same reason but keep the rest of the veggies most like how it was served in Malaysia and Indonesia. <3  The secret to having the BEST Gado-Gado is the fresh peanut sauce that is used as the dressing.  If making it fresh isn't your thing, try using Bangkok Padang Peanut Sauce found in your local Safeway store in the Ethic region.  It's the most like the Indonesian/Malay sauce served with this salad.  MOST recipes in Malaysia include Tofu cut into small cubes, dusted in cornstarch and fried up in a wok and then added on top of the salad just before serving.  It's wonderful!!  Thanks for this recipe Carol H!",2013-01-30

I omitted the sunflower seeds, apricots and golden raisins and added walnuts, cashews, mango slices and chopped dates. These bars were DEVINE!!!! Will pick up nuts during sales, make these up, vacuum seal them and freeze them. Thanks for the recipe! Gonna try a tropical type next time with mango, pineapple, coconut and macadamia. YUMMY!<br/><br/>I had no trouble with them falling apart, but I did make sure to boil the syrup mixture for 1 minutes AND made sure to coat all of the ingredients with the syrup mixture. Be sure to only count the rapid boiling time, not the initial bubbling. Also when you put them in the pan, follow the step of wetting your fingers and packing them in the pan tightly. It does help bond them. I actually pulled up my sleeves and wet my whole hands and packed them in.",2011-12-13

It could be that I didn't boil the sugar mixture long enough or that I was experimenting with the syrup component and used 1/2 honey and 1/2 corn syrup (I used only corn syrup the other times). I want to try it with agave and brown rice syrup to see how that will impact taste and how well they hold together. I've also only made it with almond butter so far and have gotten great results! Oh, one other thing: I skip the sunflower seeds and use sesame seeds that I toast up first. Instead of putting them in the mixture, I press them on the top after I've pressed the bars into the pan.",2012-05-22

I will be making this again and probably as a Christmas snack for the family.

I also found a Lindt 70% cocoa bar at a great price so I decided to use that for the chocolate instead.  It was very rich and very good.  I imagine that you could use just about any chocolate you would like but a milk chocolate may have too much high of fat content to settle properly.  It would be worth experimenting.  The red wine sauce (I used ChateauGigault from a local Washington winery) really made this dessert extra special.  I would have never in a million years have thought to do that!

The next day they were so moist I was afraid to eat them.  I tried a cookie soon after baking and the flavors were good but the moisture is a huge issue.  I am wondering if you chopped up the strawberries if that would not work better instead of mounding around a small one?

I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 Smart Balance with tasty results, and crushed red pepper for the chiles since I was feeding it to a 2 year old. I was a bit concerned about the amount of black pepper being too much, but it was spot on. I took a different approach with the eggs based on other pseudo-carbonara recipes I've made: I beat the eggs, cheese, and pepper together, then combined them with the hot noodles after they were finished cooking. When I put the noodles in the veggie pan the eggs cooked through, and a bit of pasta water made for a nice consistency. I'm sure it was not as creamy as runny egg would make it, but DH is averse to such things so I do what I can :).

Fried the eggs because I've never poached an egg and I was worried I would screw it up. ;-) Used red chile pepper flakes since I didn't have fresh. Oh, and I didn't have any spaghetti, linguine, or fettucine (I was shocked), so I used gemelli (kind of like a tight rotini) and it worked just fine. Next time, I would add even more of the chard stems -- they really picked up all the flavors of the dish and added a great texture.

I made some adjustments - I used 2 granny smith apples, 1/4 cup of butter (could cut down to 3tbsp), 2 tbsp of brown sugar, 3 tbsp of honey and 1/2 - 3/4 tsp of cinnamon and sprinkled on some lemon juice.  Same ingredients but this was just the right amount of sweetness for me.  Thanks!",2009-06-01
208870,901757,4,1,It was excellent! Instead of 1 c of unsalted butter I used 1/2 c. This recipe really made the crepe delicious. Thank you so much!!,2008-08-07
208870,1247585,4,1,"Really great simple recipe. I agree with the other two comments, you really don&#039;t need that much margarine/butter, I put just enough to saute the apples and didn&#039;t feel the need to add more. Used equal amounts of local unpasteurized honey (a good season allergy cure!) and brown sugar, a little salt in addition to the lemon to cut the sweetness and it was just perfect, I didn&#039;t even need to eat the crepes with syrup or anything. In the future I would add cranberries and almonds or walnuts.. I think that would be amazing.",2013-09-29
105636,222478,5,1,Great idea Dale! The small local supermarket I went to didn't have any pork schnitzels so I diced up some pork butterfly loins instead and made some Marinated and Crumbed Pork Schnitzel (Recipe #128745). I served with some honeyed prawns (recipe #95360) on skewers and the two complemented each other nicely. Would also be good with some pineapple pieces in between.,2006-04-14

28651,160977,5,1,Great in spite of the things I had to change. Here we do not have any andouille sausages (and since we do not eat pork-meat I probably would not have been able to use them even if I could find it). So-I bought Mergez sausages. Spicy lamb-meat sausages. And I omitted the cup of cooked ham (for the same resons as above). These were the only changes I made. When serving I also had a bottle of Louisiana hot sauce on the table in case someone would like it hotter. Most guests had seconds and one even had a fourth serving. (I had made a lot!)The pan was scraped completely clean. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.,2005-06-30
28651,294461,5,1,"I made quite a few substitutions to this as my British supermarket lacked a few of the ingredients: 
I used spanish Choritzo sausage, sunflower oil instead of peanut oil, bacon instead of ham, pureed tomatoes instead of cajun style tomatoes and chicken stock instead of chicken broth. But I kept to all the specified quantities (apart from when my dad kept adding extra tabasco behind my back!)
I cooked it all in a large wok. It was just the right spiciness and it was very savoury. My boyfriend absolutely loved it and keeps asking me to make it again! Thanks for posting this :)",2006-09-14

I tried it on 7/2/13 and found today that it had already been posted, so it saves me the trouble! I had blueberries and strawberries, and substituted chopped pecans for the almonds. It really makes more like 8 moderately-sized &lt;br/&gt;servings, and it&#039;s good with just a little bit of vanilla ice cream melting on the side (but what isn&#039;t?). You could use any nut you like instead of the almonds, and pretty much any soft fruit you have on hand, like peached, plums, cherries, etc. I did find I needed to increase the amount of baking time, but there were other things cooking in the oven so the circulation of hot air was likely impeded.

Instead of processed cheese, I used 3 cups sharp white cheddar cheese, 1 1/2 cups swiss cheese-gruyere, and 1 1/2 cups smoked provolone (a combination simulating Provel processed cheese, but using premium ingredients).  Because this was a crockpot meal, I scooped out portions.  We had a hard time finding the cheese, and the special flavors of the cheeses were lost.  So for this recipe, I would use orange cheddar cheese or cut up Velveeta, and not try to add a gourmet touch.  I was glad that the recipe did not call for additional salt because the canned soup and the cheese gave it enough. I like to see my cheese, and know that each portion is getting its share, so I would not add the cheese to the crockpot, but put each dinner portion in a French Onion Soup bowl, sprinkle the cheese, and melt under the broiler or in the oven.

We all enjoyed this, and seeing as I was preparing it for a large crowd, I was happy to have a simple dish that could be prepped quickly.  I would recommend erring on the side of more garlic salt than less.  I used about 1 tsp when tripling the recipe and thought it could have used more.

I used a reviewer's suggestion and added 1 tbs. of balsamic.  It was delicious, but I was furious that I actually used tyme instead of fresh basil, so I made it a second time.

The second batch was just as delicious.   I took some of both to the family I work for, and they all said it was delicious, and thought both versions were equally superb.  

I used halved cherry tomatoes in both batches.  I plan on making a third batch, and possibly slicing the cukes, onions and tomatoes thin to see what I think.

I love an excuse to go to my Health Food store and go wild!!!  The only slight alterations I made were that my almonds were raw & whole (I chopped some and left some as is) and I threw in flax seed to the lot as well -just because I wanted to :).   Lovely, crispy, nutty granola - with the perfect hint of sweetness. I did have to cook mine for more like 1 and 3/4 of an hour (no biggie , just kept my eye on it every 15-20 min. to give it a stir).  This makes a truck load...I filled 5 quarts of empty yogurt containers with it and have to  give more than 1/2 of it away to get it away from me...this kind of thing is my downfall and I WILL eat it all if it is around me...sooooo good and good for you.  I plan to make 1/2 batch next time and to celebrate the Autumn Season use pumpkin seeds and cranberry in place of the sunflower and raisins.  Love-love-loved this - THANKS SYD!!! :)",2007-09-21

208539,102058,5,1,"10 stars ! I didn't add the dry milk or soya flour because I couldn't find any, and I used whole almonds instead of slivered and also added some peanuts since I adore nuts.  I toasted it all for a little longer because I like it darker toasted to produce a fantastic museli / granola. Everything works together very well and this is an excellent way to convince a non-breakfast eater that breakfast can actually be worthwhile. I might throw in some pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries next batch too. It makes a LOT, perfect because it's so easy and tasty. Even better.. when the rest of the family went for icecream for dessert I had a small bowl of this, and was completey happy and not missing the sweet stuff. It should stave off the dreaded late evening munchies very well indeed too. Please see my Rating System: 5 excellent stars for a fantastic recipe that can be easily adapted (more nuts, more bran, dried fruit etc) to suit everyones tastes, healthy, economical and is a simply delicious way to start the day.

A few substitutions.  I do feel this recipe is versatile enough that I could do this w/o compromising the recipe.  I omited the soya flour, bran flakes, wheat germ, coconut and cashews.  I subbed in dates (per your suggestion in the forward), craisins, flax seed meal and about 1/2 t. cinnamon.

First, it doesn't say whether the rice needs to be cooked or if it should be raw before adding to the crockpot.  I decided that it needed to be cooked because I don't think there would be nearly enough liquid to cook the rice while in the crockpot.  Second, the recipe was terribly bland.  I added chili powder and cumin to give it more flavor.  When I put it in the tortilla, I added sour cream and salsa.  The sour cream seemed to get lost but the salsa gave the dish the kick it very much needed.  I have lots of leftovers, I got 8 servings out of it, but that obviously depends on how much you want to put in the tortilla.

One tip from the tv show I watched where she made these -- she used her digital scale and recommended that each ball weigh exactly one ounce, and so I got out my scale and followed her advice. I did like the taste of the coconut on the outside of the cookies and also think they are quite attractive.

The second time I tried 'braising' the chicken cause I want to try it with more sauce. So i sear the chicken in a hot skillet (with some olive oil) for about 10sec each side to get it browned. Then I return the chicken and marinade into a saucepan, added about 1/4 cup chicken stock and let it simmer for an hour. Just before serving, I thickened the sauce slightly with a mixture of cornstarch and cold water. I love the braised version even more!! I followed all the ingredients to the T. Please do not omit or sub the garam masala - it will not be the same without it! And I used galangal instead of the regular ginger. I'm still salivating, just recalling the taste of this dish...

Thinking that 2 1/2 tsp was maybe too much salt, I reduced that to 1 1/2, but turns out 2 1/2 is probably right on the money. My own adaptations included using a mixture of reduced fat cheeses (cheddar, farmer, parmesan), and some different flours (mostly whole wheat pastry flour, a quarter cup of soy powder, a cup of whole wheat, and a cup of all-purpose). With the whole grain flours in there, I added some vital wheat gluten and a couple tsp of balsamic vinegar to ensure a good rise. This bread would lend itself nicely to other fillings along with the cheese, like pepperoni and sun-dried tomatoes for a pizza cheese bread, or perhaps some oregano and feta for a Greek bread, or (my personal favorite) jalapenos and pepperjack (ole!).

I didn't know how you could warm the dough in a microwave with water steam, or that the dough could be rolled different ways. I also had no idea how much dough this made. A person could easily use half the dough and freeze the other half. I also thought 8C. of flour was too much. I added it, but realized I didn't need it all. Also, 1C of butter to spread on top of the dough was too much as well. 1/2C. is plenty! The brown sugar/cinnamon mixture was more than enough as well. I used 1/2 to 3/4 of it.",2011-11-14

My 16 yr old son has eaten all of my previous attempts and he tells me this ones a keeper and I have to agree.  The dough makes a delicious roll and this recipe tastes like I am eating the original Cinnabon.  I did however use dark brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar and 2 and a half TB of the cinnamon.  Otherwise I followed the recipe perfectly.  It is time consuming due to the dough rising 3 different times, so plan accordingly.  I think they could be made the day before and covered with foil to reheat in the oven before adding the cream cheese frosting.  It does make a large amount and I think 1 cup of butter brushed on the dough before sprinkling the brown sugar mixture on it is way too much.  1/2 c melted butter should be plenty. I used some of it to brush on bottom and sides of pan before placing the rolls in it to bake.  I used an 11 x 17 pan, but it could have been bigger.  I suppose you could do this in 2-9x13 pans easily with 12 in each pan.  I cut my rolls too thin and had 26 rolls I squeezed into the pan and it was too crowded.&lt;br/&gt;Next time I will try making 1/2 the recipe in one 9x13 pan with 12 rolls in it.Thank you Bliss for sharing a wonderful recipe.

The sauce that I had years ago had red pepper flakes in it, so I substituted that for the cayenne.

Well, it wasn't hot enough, and we were camping, so I didn't have all my seasonings available.  Somebody produced a bottle of hot sauce, and we used that.  It was great, but not an exact science.  I would recommend adding a little, mix, and taste.  Add more, mix, and taste.  That's what we did.

31020,59608,5,1,"This is the perfect accompaniment.  Easy as anything to make.  
I agree with Tracy when she says that you just use  a small amount, rather than pour it over like a regular BBQ sauce.  It is too thin to do that anyway - a little goes a long way.  I like the way the vinegaryness of it cuts the richness of the meat.    Excellent.",2002-11-11

31020,55690,5,1,"I have to agree with Jaymee.  This is the sauce I remember so well in NC.. and I also added the red pepper flakes.

Now I just need to find that recipe for barbecued slaw to go with it.  YUMMMM",2002-12-01
31020,35193,5,1,"I made this in addition to the other sauce with the pulled pork.  It was excellent and tangy/spicy/sweet.  It takes the pork in a whole different direction.  Very cool!  You can have dinner two nights with the same pulled pork, with different sauce each night and different accompaniments.  It's a snap to whip up and I always have these ingredients on hand.  Thanks for posting these wonderful recipes!",2003-04-25
31020,72483,5,1,When I made this...I tasted it before I put it on the pork....I normally am a fan of vinegary sauces...North Carolina style....I thought it seemed like a dressing more than a sauce...then I put it on my pork and whoa nelly! It really compliments the flavor in a beautiful way!!! It is so simple that it seems like it can't be as good as something more complicated....DON'T LET THE SIMPLICITY SCARE YOU AWAY!

My DH isn't much on vinegar-based anything, so he proclaimed that he wouldn't be interested in this sauce.  Funny, I think he used most of it.  The sauce adds the perfect kick to the pork and really helps to keep the meat moist but not greasy.  We ended up using more of this than the BBQ sauce (which is delicious) and this surprised me.  I followed the directions exactly, and we just splashed a bit on individual servings as desired.  Delicious!",2003-10-14
31020,8526,3,0,"This was much too vinegary for me. The vinegar was so over powering, I couldn't taste anything else in the sauce except for the cayenne. I had to add a lot more brown sugar to get it to where I liked it. I think in the end, I added probably a cup of brown sugar. A tablespoon just didn't cut it with a whole cup of vinegar. I'm sorry this didn't work out for me like your other recipes. ",2003-10-17

31020,117440,5,1,"I thought this was a wonderful sauce for the pulled pig.  If you don't like vinegar, I recommend just drizzling a little bit and then perhaps mixing the bbq sauce in as well.  I think it truly sets off the flavor of the pork and the vinegar helps ""open up"" the flavors of everything else.  Again, I recommend if serving on rolls, each person have a small bowl to mix the sauces into the pork to their own taste.  Thanks again!",2005-02-15
31020,50445,5,1,"This sauce is a little vinegary, but that just happens to be the way I like it.  I think it is a wonderful accent to the pulled pork.  I don't know if it was my imagination, but the longer this sauce sat out, it became even more vinegary. Possibly just not stirred well.

I'd never had this style before, but figured that anything which came recommended by Mean Chef and QDM was definitely worth a try. I'm glad I did. The vinegar flavor *is* very strong and I ended up probably doubling the black pepper and doubling, perhaps tripling, the brown sugar, to even it out a bit.

31020,37026,5,1,This is a great vinegar type sauce to go with pork. Quick and easy with a fabulous kick.  We had a pig roast this summer and used this sauce along with the usual bbq sauces and such.  Everyone loved this on their sandwiches and just sprinkled over the meat on the plates. We even use this on a pork roast out of the oven! I've made this a few times now and the only changes I made the second time was to increase the sugar to a 1/4 cup. I've also used crushed red pepper flakes and I bring the whole thing to a boil in a saucepan before using it to disolve the sugar and let the flakes release a little of their heat.

I also used a new crust recipe that compliments the spices in your recipe.  The flavors are the best.

420012,593927,5,1,"5 stars!! Very tasty along with the dibis tamar and a Balkan (thick) yogurt. This was exactly what I had been searching for and DH, DD (toddler) & I thoroughly enjoyed it. DH's family eats this with melted butter mixed with the dibis which I will do next time insha Allah along with yogurt too. I did dot butter on top. I made this the traditional way but not with any meat. DH also said his family mixes theirs but we liked it layered mixed is just easier. Layering it I had to cook it differently. Here is what I did: I cooked the onion in some oil in my cast iron frying pan and then added the fresh dill and some sea salt to taste. I added this to the drained soaked mung (mash) beans with some water and cooked them until tender. There was still a little liquid left so I retained it for the rice. I cooked white basmati rice in some boiling salted water for exactly 8 minutes and then drained and put into a greased pan to set in a low oven once layered with the bean mixture. I sprinkled some of the left over liquid on top and covered the pan with aluminum foil and left it in the oven until done. I will definitely will make this again and again.",2010-04-14

Since I rely on my trusty rice cooker, I basically just cooked the mung beans and rice separately and layered them together, then baked them in the oven for a while to allow the flavors to marry.

120317,154044,5,1,"I didn't get the beautiful ribbon that Chef~V got in her photos...(how DID you do that?!?), but this was a really good cake. I iced it with a mocha icing. Mental notes to future self: Don't try to ice it on a platter that's ""just the right size""...especially if it has scalloped edges. I had a terrible time trying to get it to stay on the platter...it kept trying to drip off around the scalloped sides. However, the cake was great, and I'd make it again in a heartbeat! :D  PS: Fwiw, I've found it's best when they've had a chance to sit in the fridge overnight and let the flavors meld. Update 5/27/08: Okay...guilty confession time. I went to a church retreat last weekend. We were supposed to bring a large dessert to share over the weekend. So I planned on making two of your cakes (in two 20"" x 20"" pans) and Chef~V's Recipe #303413 (changes I made noted in my review). I was racing around getting stuff done and needed to multi-task. So I tossed the cakes in the oven and raced down to drop my sleeping bag off at the laundromat. Realized I needed to get the espresso for the frosting. :evil: So I did that on the way back. Got back...and had been longer than I realized. Opened the front door to smell scorched cake. :evil: I REALLY didn't have time to remake them, but my neighbor agreed to run down to the store for me to pick up the supplies. While the neighbor was gone, I decided to try a piece of the cake, as there were some spots that weren't as dark. Used a 3-tined salad/meat spork to cut a piece out, cutting the scorched part off of the bottom as I did it. Hmmm...not bad. The inside and top didn't actually taste scorched. Too bad I couldn't serve it as the icing was already done and sitting there.

Hmmmm...

Grabbed a large piece of aluminum foil and set my cake rack on top. Continued to ""spork"" the pieces of cake out, in about 3""x3"" squares, laying them upside down on the rack (ragged edge up). Salvaged what I could from both pans...not getting any that was too dark. Spooned the mocha ganache over the top. Let it set. Placed it on a serving tray and carefully covered it. They were absolutely TDF. I had a number of people come up and comment on them, begging me for the recipe. Nobody ever knew how close I came to just scraping both pans out and skipping it. :D",2008-05-27

90375,77267,0,0,Very tasty! The stew bursts with flavor. I served it with old world flatbread which paired with it nicely. I'll try the rice next time. It wasn't too difficult to make. Took me about an hour and a half working quickly. Great as a starter or on its own.,2004-07-28
90375,930100,5,1,"My husband made this for dinner tonight. We both really enjoyed it. I used your suggestions and made with Pyramid Apricot ale, topped with sour cream and cilantro and served with crusty bread. Delicious dish, we will make again.",2010-11-14
90375,229448,5,1,"Made this a few weeks ago and plan on making it again this week. I WAY over peppered it. I added a few dried thai chiles and it didn't seem hot enough, so added some more hot chile powder. At some point I should have stopped. It was SO HOT, but we ate it anyway and it was delicious! I went to but the beer and could not remember what kind and I ended up with a belgian ale. It worked really well! I omitted the sugar and the cilantro. Can't wait to have it again. :)",2011-12-09

468776,1609858,4,1,"Nice and moist.  Not a very sweet cupcake.  They also didn&#039;t taste super almondy to me.  Next time I might sub in almond extract for the vanilla.  I wasn&#039;t crazy about the ground almonds and the texture they added, but that&#039;s just me.  Overall a nice treat.  I did really like the lemonglaze and thought it turned out better than other glazes I&#039;ve made.  They are very pretty. I can&#039;t find my camera, or I would post a pic.  I think they would be nice at a shower or at a fancy luncheon or tea.  Made for PAC Spring 2013. Update: Found my camera and was able to snap a pic before the cupcakes disappeared.  Yeah!  I must also add that this really is a VERY moist cupcake.",2013-04-17

I used IKEA's marzipan, it has not very intense taste as sole but I think it was enough to give a good almond aroma to whole cake. I used the exact amount of ingredients and it was enough to fill 6 small cupcake tins and a medium cake tin.",2018-03-30
408193,233583,5,1,"First let me say this is soooooo good!  I bet you are right the Hungarian paprika gave this dish a slant in a different direction.  I rarely use this particular paprika as it is hard to find hre so I had my mom send me some from the store she shops at in Cali. I did not add in the tomatoe sauce as the cut tomatoes looked so perfect in the dish.  I put 1/2 in 10 min into the cooking and the other half at the end of cooking to keep the texture in tact.  I served over angelhair pasta, with your beer batter rye bread (made again) and a green salad.  This is a comapny ready dish!  I am lucky that I love chicken as these two recieps of yours are definielty in my favorites.  I love the hint of garlic and will probably add even more next time.

174446,102058,4,1,Loved it.. this went of top of icecream and went down very well indeed. The Grand Marnier gives a depth of flavour and cuts the sweetnees just a tad. The cinnamon and cardamom are a good match for the blueberries. Please see my rating system: 4 wonderful stars for a very yummy topping. Thanks!,2007-06-20

98502,73836,5,1,"This was a lovely soup. I halved the recipe with no problems as there are only two of us. I had to make some changes as we don't have frozen hash browns over here. I used cubed raw potato and did not add any butter, adding only the onions and broth, I also used a ham broth cube.  When I went to get my can of corn, I realized all I had was cans of creamed corn, so I used one of those instead with excellent results!  Because it was creamed corn I did not add all the milk.  I used the parsley, salt, pepper and added 1/2 tsp summer savory.  We both enjoyed this soup very much and I can promise that it is a soup I will be making again and again!  Thanks so much for a wonderful new way of preparing potato soup!",2004-11-21

98502,57101,5,1,"I really liked this soup.  I like that the potatoes are mashed up.  I used my hand mixer to do that step.  I substituted the parsley with dill weed and added about 1/2 tsp garlic.  Oh, I also added a stalk of celery, chopped and a few baby carrots shredded for some extra flavor and veggies.  I think this will be my standing potato soup recipe.",2008-12-06
98502,199848,5,1,"Yay... no potato peeling!   For such and easy soup, this was quite yummy.  I added some extra onion, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  The corn added a nice sweetness.  Thanx for a posting this!",2009-03-01

476743,58104,5,1,I must say I didn`t make this recipe. I bought the ingredients and my Sister Lydia Chef #66708 put it together. I know she did add twice the amount of cream cheese. The Onion should really state in amount because a small onion is so different from one type onion to an other. I would think 1/4 cup diced would have been prefect. But!  put that aside my  Mom sat their eating away really enjoying it. I mentioned all the onion in it. She turned to me and said what this isn`t crab dip? Why she got crab out of it I don`t know but it was the most inexpensive crab dip she ever ate! LOL! I served it along side Recipe #149199<br/>for dipping the veggies into it. It would be yummy on toasted bagels.Thanks Lala made for veggie tag,2012-12-11

I used the rice flours mentioned in that recipe and a little change in the starches (tapioca starch and sweet rice flour, no potato starch) but kept to that gluten free recipe for the rest of the dry ingredients. I used a bit of extra baking soda and 1 tbs organic apple cider vinegar instead of the baking powder. I used the butter called for in this recipe plus some canola oil as gluten free needed more, I used a halal vanilla paste, sea salt, brown sugar and the rest. I may make these again the same way.

I didn't have chive and onion cream cheese, so I used palin cream cheese and added extra onion to the ground beef.

97272,119466,0,0,"I couldn't decide how to rate this recipe, so I am opting to just add my comments without assigning a star rating. I ended up with decent cookies, but I did have to do some tinkering. Although I was tempted to sub honey for the corn syrup, I didn't want to make many changes since this recipe appears to be an untested one. The only changes I had intended to make were to sub white whole-wheat flour for 1 cup of the all-purpose and sub craisins for the raisins. Relative to the rest of the ingredients, a cup of egg substitute (the equivalent of about 4 eggs) and 1/2 cup of corn syrup seemed like a lot, but I have little experience with low-fat cookies, so I thought I could be wrong. The resulting mixture after combining all of the ingredients (except for the craisins and nuts) was more like a batter you could pour than a drop cookie dough. Perhaps I wasn't paying attention and made an error, but I ended up having to add about 1 1/2 cups additional flour to get anything close to what I would consider cookie dough. (In retrospect, I wished I had used additional oats to make up part of the difference, rather than all flour--they needed more oats to suit me.) I then added the craisins and nuts (pecans), used a cookie scoop to drop on parchment-lined pans, and baked in a convection oven at 325F for about 12 minutes. The cookies (I ended up with 4 1/2 dozen) were a little cake-like, but had a nice ""chew"" and good flavor. I'd be interested in trying this recipe again, maybe cutting the egg substitute and corn syrup in half, adding more oats, and going from there. I would definitely bake them on parchment paper, as the corn syrup made the bottoms sticky. Actually, I found it easier to just let them cool enough to peel off of the paper, rather than trying to slide a spatula under them. Thanks for adopting the recipe. I think that it has potential, but needs a little work.",2007-06-08

I also added a good hit of fresh ground pepper and a bit of coarse sea salt.  I used two pounds of mussels (didn't count them)and the resulting dish was two very generous servings.

423694,157425,5,1,This marinade smelled wonderful and made some juicy nice flavored grilled eye of round steaks. I did run into a few snags and had to make some substitutions. Was out of honey mustard so I used dijon with 1 tablespoon of honey. Swore I had pickling spice and caraway seeds but was out so I used celery seed for the caraway and a internet search found some quick subs for the pickling spice. I think this was great marinade but with the correct ingredients would be super. Made and reviewed for KC's Recipe Tag Game.,2010-08-18

I used a sweet red pepper instead of green to make it look more authentic.  It was a very pale green, so I added a few drops of green food coloring. I got 4 half pint jars.

185520,211184,4,1,We enjoyed this for dinner last night. The meat mixture may seem quite moist as you're mixing it up but it does firm up nicely when baked. We liked the addition of the tomato sauce topping as well. The only recommendation I would have is if you have an insert for your loaf pan to keep the meatloaf from touching the bottom use it. The addition of ground sausage did make it a little greasy in the bottom of the pan. I baked mine for about 1 hour 10 minutes. *Made for PAC Spring 2010*,2010-04-18

Also, the Cake Mix Doctor recipe says prepare one-HALF of the peppermint filling.  (you only need to cover one layer with it - although I noticed Dragonfly suggest using the extra as a garnish).  And in the ganache, you can use 1/2 tsp of the extract, or 1 Tbsp of the schnapps.  Also, instead of letting the ganache sit for 4 hours, I stick it in the fridge for about 20 minutes.

I added an additional 2 tsp. of gluten and small pinch of extra yeast to compensate for being kneaded by hand rather than in a mixer. It would have looked better if I had a smaller loaf pan to make in it, rather than my 9.5 X 4.5 inch. I am still happy with it though. I have to admit that the smell of balsamic vinegar that came off the dough while I kneaded it was a little off putting. Honestly I didn&#039;t expect much from this bread. I was totally wrong. The bread has a really nice, simple but good flavor. It&#039;s not at all sour. A person would probably have to ask what acid was used in it as the balsamic flavor is not striking. But it&#039;s very nice. The bread is dense but not heavy. It&#039;s slighty moist because of the yogurt. The rye flavor is not very pronounced. In a nutshell, you might call this a pleasant, interesting wheat bread with a texture more like rye bread. It makes a tasty loaf without the use white flour. That is not easily done.

If you can't get them, do use a top-quality, *homegrown* substitute that's very ripe.

The hotter the weather the better this dessert will be received :) It has a zing of fruitiness that has to be tasted to be believed. (I used peaches)I'm going to try this using apricots soonest...It was easy to make and uses just few simple ingredients so is also an economical dessert that makes a lot, ideal for after a BBQ party etc. After blitzing my fruit in the food processor etc I froze mine for more than an hour while we were busy with our main course... yes it definiately needed processing again before serving. I don't see why this received one star before... all recipes come from somewhere, right? I topped the dish with a little pureed fresh strawberries just for an extra swirl of decorative colour, it wasn't necessary to add to the taste in any way. The one drawback of this recipe is that as a nursing Mama I ate waaaaay too much of this and it gave baby a lot of wind... until he's weaned I'll have to have limit my portion size.

It was definitely alot lighter than the usual curry I make(I have a thing for SE Asian curries, so I rarely try other one) but I wanted to do something different with my excess bananas. This only used one, and later on thought I should have added more, but then I ate it and decided 'No.' The banana added a very subtle flavour to this, and it was really nice and easy. I'm so glad I had everything on hand. I used one can of tomatoes and I want to say thankyou so much for this different and delicious recipe!",2005-09-14
52807,67656,5,1,"Just wonderful.  I was somewhat stumped about the sequencing and when the pumpkin was to be incorporated in the curry. After sauteeing the onions, peppers, garlic and spices, I moved them to a bowl.  Then cooked up the pumkin and curry paste.  After 5 minutes added the onions and pepers back in and continued with the dish. Managed to also reduce the total amount of oil to 1 tablespoon by using some extra vegetable stock to soften the onions.  Used fresh tomatoes but think this would work equally well with the canned variety. My final tweak was that I used a very ripe plaintain instead of the banana, a simple matter of availability and preference for cooking with plantains as they hold there shape a bit better.  Will certainly make this soon as it was thoroughly enjoyed.  Imagining variations with small amounts of chicken in lieu of some of the chickpeas, or a light addition of allspice.

I loved all the flavours in this one although I must say I found it a bit too tomato sauce flavoured for my liking until adding the hoisin.

I went over ingredients time and time again and know for sure I did not make a mistake.  I will try again when I have extra eggs and sugar to spare!  So sorry, wish these would have worked better for me...",2008-04-09

I found the littleneck clams on the small side and really didn&#039;t absorb a lot of the flavor on their own.  I would use cherrystone clams next time, as they are meatier and really soak up the garlic, etc.  The jalapeno added just the right amount of heat and was a great addition.  I also might forego the water next time, as the broth was just a little too soup-y for me.  The tomatoes and clams by themselves give off enough liquid, I think, to make a super flavorful broth that would be ideal for dunking with some crusty bread.

I used japanese short grain rice, two pressed garlic cloves, and dried parsley (too lazy to brave the rain for fresh).  I used an ice cream scoop to help form the balls, which worked really well, as the mixture was a little loose, even after refrigerating.  After rolling the balls, I froze for 20 minutes to make them firmer.  For me, this seemed to eliminate the problem of having them fall apart while frying.  They came out of the fryer round and beautiful.  To cook, I used my deep frier, set for 375 degrees.  They came out a bit darker than I had expected, but were done all the way through, and not at all burned.  These definately deserve 5 stars, but I will tweek them a bit next time (sorry, can't help myself).  First, cook the rice in broth, rather than water, for more flavor.  I'll go with the fresh parsley next time, rather than dried.  In fact, I may add different herbs, depending on what I have available in the garden.

As the balls were a little bit still sticky, because of the egg, decided not to coat with egg, then mixed the breadcrumbs and the flour, this to handle the arancinis less time possible before frying.

38418,39949,5,1,"GREAT recipe!  I couldn't find pork scallopini, so instead bought thin-sliced bone-in pork chops, and cut the meat off the bone.  I made the recipe exactly as directed after that, except for adding a bit more butter for sauteeing (maybe 1 T, total).  Everything came together exactly as I expected, and the flavors were outstanding.   The mustard was not overpowering at all, but lent a subtle spiciness, along with the worcestershire sauce.  The sauteed crimini mushrooms (which I used) were especially excellent in the sauce, which thickened up nicely.  This was delicious and lovely, which was important to me, because I made this to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the day DH and I met.  I was lucky to make this delicious, lovely meal for an important date for us, and I would be proud to make this for company, too.  The only changes I might make in the future would be to add some thyme or a bit of sage, maybe, when sauteeing the mushrooms, and to add a bit more black pepper.

     There is one minor typo in steps 38, 39 and 40, as far as I can tell: the recipe calls for 1/3 of filling in Step 38, and another 1/3 in step 39. The final third is un-used.  (I think the intention is to one half in Step 38 and the other in 39.) If you end up with too much filling, I suggest you do what I did: grab a spoon and enjoy that last third -- it's a delicious pudding!

This time I found a ""whole grain"" mix of bulgur and toasted orzo pasta.  Cooked bulgur has a dense and meaty texture which made this recipe filling.  The recipe did not state whether to drain the canned beans and corn, but I did (and used a 10 ounze package of frozen corn instead of canned), so I added another 1/2 cup of vegetable broth.

It's a simple recipe, and adding the mushrooms and onions really adds a nice dimension. I added in some garlic and fresh parsley to the mushrooms.

I didn't have plain sugar, so I used brown.  I will post a pic after I finish.  I really like the tart against the sweet.  I can tell the tea does add flavor.

162786,290107,3,0,"I'm afraid this didn;t work at all well for us. First, when I set out the ice cream to soften, it melted very quickly rather than slowly softening. Because of that, I had to use 2 crusts instead of one, and the cherries and nuts ended up mostly in one pie rather than evenly distributed. Also, 10 minutes softening time was waaay too long--we ended up with chocolate crust chunks in a puddle of melted goo. It wasn't very appealing to look at, although it tasted okay. I might give it another try, watching the ice cream more closely when it's softening and skipping the softening before serving. I'm not too sure I liked the cherries in it, though--but I've never liked cherries on my sundaes, either. Sorry it didn't work out this time--maybe I'll have better luck next time!",2006-05-29

I been making these for awhile now and I just came across that someone posted a recipe for these..aint much to them but they sure are good.. I got my bestfriend in texas hooked on these too.  Great snack and good for low carb diets too..,2005-03-16
108123,204628,5,1,"This is also excellent made with smoked salmon slices, probably easier to make them into little parcels rather than just rolling up.  For a special occasion put a few prawns on top before rolling up.",2005-03-22

108123,595112,5,1,"This is one of my favorite sandwiches. I spread the cream cheese then top with the salami. It makes a great rollup in a tortilla too, add a little green onion or pepperocini.",2008-05-26
108123,339260,5,1,These little rollups are addicting.  I added green onion to the center of the rollups and took them to a work luncheon.  They were a huge hit with the staff.  I think next time I am going to chop up the green onion and mix it into the cream cheese and then spread it on the salami.  Yummy!  Made for Diabetic Cooking Tag Game.,2011-05-22

211299,233616,5,1,"This was fabulous. I made it for our holiday party and people raved over it. Only thing I altered was to let the walnuts soak over night in the burbon, because I saw Paula Deen do the same for one of her recipes. Thanks so much!",2009-01-06
211299,899120,5,1,"I love to find simple recipes that make a big impact (and give the impression that I did something fabulous!)....this was easy, impressive and delicious!!  Based on another reviewer's recommendation, I soaked my walnuts in the bourbon for a couple of hours just to add some extra flavor.  I then used the bourbon from the 'soaking' in the recipe....probably double the amount called for....but it worked out just fine.  The bourbon was not overpowering  and the flavored walnuts complemented the mild brie perfectly.  The topping browned and carmelized so nicely creating a very elegant looking appetizer...only negative is that the poor little 8 oz brie did not last long!  To take to a party I'll just use a larger round of brie and double the topping.  I served with whole wheat crackers and slices of green apple.  An absolute keeper!  Thank you for sharing.",2009-05-29

As Brooke said, it doesn't get much easier or thriftier ... and yes, tastes wonderful. I made two versions, one with commercial salsa (Newman's Own) and one with a ZWT5 salsa recipe. Most commercial salsas are cooked as part of the bottling process, so the salsa chunks are a bit soft, compared to the raw ingredient salsas (a grilled vegetable salsa would be intermediate in texture). By using different salsas or by adding chile peppers, you can alter the texture and the heat of this recipe any way you like.

I pureed about 1/3 of the drained black beans to provide some adhesion without adding a lot of liquid.

Great recipe, Brooke, thanks for posting!",2009-05-21

259710,512309,5,1,"YUMMMMMM!!  This is my favorite kind of cookie -- soft, sweet, delicious, and still basically healthy!  No guilt about feeding these to my children!  I did make a couple of minor changes -- I used one whole cup of brown sugar and no white sugar.  I also used one 15-oz can of peaches (drained) along with two small 4.5-oz cans (lunch size) so there was a fair amount of liquid in my batter.  To help absorb it I added an extra 1/2 cup of wheat germ.  I added in 1 tsp of cinnamon too.
The cookies came out puffy and soft, with delicous chunks of fruit throughout.  And I knew my kids were eating healthy cookies for their snack after school!

The vegetables were roasted at 450 degrees and were done in the time specified.  Something to make again.  Thanks for posting.,2008-07-26
293843,113178,5,1,"This was a very tasty recipe!  I ended up charring the chicken a bit because i didn't know to turn down the stove.  Other than that, the chicken had wonderful flavor.  I used kraft parmasan cheese that was the crumbs which worked out great!  Instead of ripe tomatoes i used some that i had canned from this past summer and added dried basil, a little oil and the salt and pepper.  The sauce tasted very good with the chicken.  The potatoes were very very tasty and easy to cook.  I prefer to have less spice from the red pepper flakes so if you want more or less spice it would be best to alter this!  Very nummy meal and a hit with my hubby and 2 year old son.",2011-03-10

467779,2818985,5,1,"This was absolutely amazing. I made it exactly as it said, but added mushrooms with the onions and garlic.",2014-12-11
467779,194244,5,1,"Pretty much incredible!  It didn&#039;t hurt that I had freshly-made pesto since a friend had given me about a bushel of her hydroponically-grown, organic basil.    I pretty much followed the recipe, except I didn&#039;t have as much chicken as it called for.  Didn&#039;t miss it.  I also used regular lasagne noodles since it didn&#039;t seem that there would be enough moisture in the filling to cook the noodles enough.  Its maiden voyage was for a fundraiser dinner - possibly daring, but how can you go wrong with pesto?  I will definitely make this over and over, but maybe not to serve 80 people again.  It was quite a process considering I spent the better part of a day just making the pesto.   And I probably would make it without chicken.  It really didn&#039;t need it.  FYI, 6x the recipe did 3 steam-table pans for me.  No leftovers to speak of, unfortunately!",2015-05-08
467779,42847186,5,1,"This was really good, we loved it!! I made a homemade spinach walnut pesto and added 4 roasted red bell peppers, just because I love that flavor combination. Skipped the mozzarella in layers and just added it on top. Used cottage cheese in place of the ricotta and threw in some leftover silken tofu I had. All in all a great recipe that can be adjusted to your preferences!",2016-09-14
2648,229619,5,1,I picked this recipe in the Bargain Basement Game and I'm glad I did!  Can't believe nobody has tried/reviewed this one before.  I used 6 boneless breasts so it only took 25 minutes in the oven.  The pecans toast up nicely and the chicken has a wonderful flavor.  IF there's any left it will be going to work with me tomorrow!,2006-04-17
2648,2184109,1,0,I made this for dinner for a few of my friends we all were so excited to try this . But when i took it outof the oven their was still raw white flour on the pecans and chicken and most of the pecans had came off in one big clump it was not plesent to look at and i tryed it just to see and the chicken was too over done i was given an A for effort hahaha,2012-02-22
216525,1701315,4,1,"I would give this cake 5 stars for taste, but 3.5-4 for texture as it was fairly dry even baking for only 15 minutes.  Recipe #216469 really helps with the moisture, but next time I would bake it less or perhaps brush the layers with coffee liqueur or orange simple syrup.  The hints of coffee are wonderfully complimented by the freshness from the orange zest and richness of the nuts.  It is perfectly sweet, without being overly so.",2011-08-03

I also did the egg,mily, salt thing and as you suggested I did it in a large(galon size) zip lock baggie then added the califlower and stuck it in the fridge for at least 2 hours..at the same time in another LARGE baggie I did the flour and the seasonings...
got all my other supper  close to being done and these went quickly..
I was able to add all the cauliflower to the dry ingredients and it had enough room to really coat well..I do recomend the baggies..NO CLEAN UP!!

I added cayenne pepper drops to the egg mixture and used a ton of garlic and onion powders and put some Pampered Chef ""Chipolte Rub"" in the flour mix.  I also increased the parm & romano cheese blend to about 1/4 cup. I used cheddar cheese soup made with 1/2 a can of milk  to dip this in.  I had to pry myself away!

The celery would come in stalks. We would rinse then chop by hand. The apples were presliced in packets. Like the ones you get in the Arby's kids meal. Basic red apples that we would dice by hand. The pecans are the same you would buy at the store in packages. As for the mayo, it's the same mayo they would put on their sandwiches. The lettuce is just your basic green leaf lettuce that we would rinse and chop the ends every morning. Every morning we had to dice everything by hand and make fresh batches.

138892,170137,5,1,"I will definitely agree that this is the best apple pie that I've ever tasted!!!!  I wanted a heartier topping than just the normal flour, butter and sugar.  This was perfect!!  I used gala apples since that is what I had.  I think that gave it a bit of tartness, which I love in a pie.  
I did add about 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the sugar/nutmeg/cornstarch mixture--preference...I also used 2 T bottled lemon juice and no zest.
For the topping I used less brown sugar (1/2 c instead of 2/3 c)and had about 1/3 cup left over that just wouldn't fit.  
I was in a hurry and didn't read the instructions on how to bake it, just popped it in the oven at 350 F for about an hour.  For the last half hour I did cover it with tented foil to keep it from getting too brown.  And then we ate it piping hot from the oven with ice cream!  Awesome!

Let me tell you this is GREAT.  The topping creates an almost crust.  I didn't realize I had no lemon until too late and used orange, still GREAT.  REally, you must try this one.

When it was heated enough, I added the rice, then turned the heat up a bit. When a few small bubbles started for form around the edge, I turned the heat to simmer, covered the saucepan & let it go!

77050,6357,4,1,"I made this rice last night(X'mas eve) for my brother and myself. I used only 1/2 tsp. of red chilli powder(to cut down on the spiciness). Another change I made was of using whole cumin seeds instead of cumin powder. That brought out the flavour of cumin much better. I also cut down on the salt to just a tsp. I was a little puzzled as to what tomato sauce meant(I thought it meant Tomato Ketchup). Luckily, the answer was on Zaar itself. I found it by clicking on the word ""tomato paste"". I used 2 roma tomatoes(washed, peeled and chopped) and just shy of 1 cup of water to prepare the paste(tomato sauce). I loved adding saffron to this wonderful side dish!

The clumpy cereal isn't a bad thing as it's fun to eat, but it seems to waste more cereal than necessary.  Thanks for a great treat!",2004-09-07
72429,139350,5,1,I was going to post this recipe and now I don't have to!  Our family loves these little treats and they disappear very quickly.  I normally make them using Mackintosh's Toffee instead of the caramels (this recipe would use 8 bars of toffee).  They're definitely worth the mess and the sticky fingers!,2004-12-07
72429,332843,4,1,The finished product is always tasty but it can be a pain to make.  We like to serve these on our cookie trays around the holidays (but due to the 'stick factor' we don't give them as gifts).,2006-08-18
72429,362734,5,1,I got this recipe from my Grandma. I absolutely LOVE these little treats. She taught me to cut the large marshmallows in half using wet scissors. It makes them more of a bite sized treat. I've never bothered to freeze the marshmallows before assembling. I think they are worth the effort. My kids and I have fun making these together and the extra hands make the assembly go faster! Thanks for posting!-HK,2007-04-23
72429,101432,4,1,"This was a twisy on Rice Krispy treats - kinda ""inside out"" but delicious - at least my daughters thought so. One trick; we speared the marshmallows with popsicle sticks/ sucker sticks and used that handle to dip, roll, and eat these treats without the ""sticky factor""! We wrapped a few in plastic wrap, tied with a ribbon to give as favors for a party. Yummy!",2007-05-25

We poked the frozen marshmallows with skewers and then dipped them in the caramel and then the rice krispies.  You could try spraying Pam on your hands to help with the mess.  I didn't mind the mess, though.  They are SO good!!",2009-01-25
72429,140132,4,1,"We really liked these but they took a long time to prepare.  But...... they were so worth it.  The combination of marshmallow and the caramel were out of this world.  Add the crunch of the rice krispies and wow, instead delish.  DD and I were talking and we want to add coconut to the krispies next time to try.  Thank you for posting.",2009-03-06
72429,1179225,5,1,I thought these were so good. They are kind of a pain though. I cut the marshmallows in half and used a skewer to dip them in the melted caramel. I used a knife to help push them off the skewer after rolling them in the rice krispies. This recipe makes a ton. Next time I'll just make half a batch.,2011-09-26

362086,674022,5,1,This was very good. The casserole is easy to put together but one that involves a bit of chopping/prepping.  It is perfect for a weeknight meal. The color is very cream colored save for little bits of celery. I would love to add something colorful to give it a pop. The flavor is not heavily seasoned so adjust it if you find it requires more. The soup and chips are enough salt wise. We served it with a green salad with lots of veggies so that is how we got color in. Made as written. Thanks for posting 911spatcher!

The meat turned out very tender and yummy, and was enjoyed both in tortillas and next to roasted potatoes and calabacitas. I did add a fair amount of garlic and salt, and I am thinking it is important to have the most flavorful salsa possible. I also think next time (and there will be a next time!!) I will use chicken broth instead of water (or beef broth--you get the picture!). Thanks, AZ! Made for 123 Hits Tag.",2011-04-13

I would highly recommend using your hands to mix all of the ingredients together, as it gets very difficult using a hand mixer.  Also, make sure you use a big mixing bowl because two pounds of powdered sugar can get messy! Hehe! Thanks for the great recipe! :)",2005-03-25
23609,246375,4,1,"These are VERY sweet. I guess 2lb of sugar should have been a clue huh? lol. I didn't have trouble mixing this but when I tasted the mix it was clear that it was kind of ""patchy"" (one piece tasted like sugar one like cream cheese one like peanut butter) so I went in and mixed with my hands as the other reviewer said and that did indeed incorporate it. I also added another 1/2 cup of peanut butter. What can I say I love my peanut butter.  Next time I think I might try swaping graham cracker crumbs for some of the sugar (1 cup to 1 cup ratio). Graham cracker crumbs make a great binder in place of sugar and would cut down on the sweetness of these eggs...so I can eat more of them without getting sick :).

My market didnt have any sirloin that was thick at all so I had to use2 thinner steaks and layered the mixture on one then layed the other over the top and used my turkey needles/pins to kind of ""sew"" it all together as I didnt want it all falling through on the grill. With the thin steak mine was done in less than 15 minutes even on low.  Next time I will raise the heat and cook it slightly faster if I use thin steak.  Using thick steak I can see where you would almost have to do a slow bake to get the inside close to being done then sear it.  Mushrooms would also be a great addtion to the mix.  Thanks!",2006-05-27

In many words: The pizza was great, but be careful with the cilantro. First off, 1/2 cup of cilantro is a lot, and many people in the US aren't fond of the flavor, especially me. I would say 1/4 cup at most, and none at all if you don't like it (cause it's very potent).",2008-01-31

I used 2 large cans of white meat chicken and sauted it with the onions and garlic.  I'm not a huge fan of cilantro but I wanted to stay true the recipe so I used about 1/4 cup split between the 2 pizzas.  I actually think I will use more cilantro next time as it really went well with the rest of the flavors.  I don't think I will use 1/2 cup though as I think it would be a little too much.  I used Sweet Baby Rays' BBQ sauce (our favorite) and thin pre-packaged pizza crusts that turned out super crispy and yummy.

You really can customize the seasonings to your taste. I just shook some garlic powder, basil, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper into the bag and added some water, then shook the pitas in it. They turned out great, and the ladies at work all agreed. Some of the reviews mention using oil, but unless you need the calories or like the taste, I wouldn't bother.

I made a milder version and, after much consideration, as to what I could add (sometimes I just leave the hot ingredient out) I decided to try it with an Australian spice: dried and chopped lemon myrtle leaf.  On the jar it is described as having ‚Äúa unique lemon flavour with eucalyptus notes in the background‚Äù.  The only other changes I made were to double the garlic and the walnuts.  I included half the walnuts in with the ingredients processed and the other half I chopped roughly and mixed into the dip, so that there was more variation in the texture.

He said he did cook the eggplant longer than recommended, but we won't eat eggplant unless its very well-done.  We had to omit the fresh basil as I forgot it at the store, but did add a nice amount of organic dried basil to try and compensate.  Otherwise, followed the recipe, including the saffron.  We used red bell pepper and canned tomatoes and used 2 small thai peppers for the peppers.  Nice and spicy...spicy as in spiced!  This has terrific Indianic flavors!  We served over brown rice with a dollop of yogurt as suggested.  SO yummy.  We used 1 yellow zucchini, 1 pattypan squash and 1 scallopini squash (like pattypan, but green like a normal zucchini).

Also, if you are serving this over brown rice, try adding some hulled (or pearled if you prefer)barley to the rice - cook 5-10 minutes first then add the brown rice to the water. Barley has the lowest glycemic index scale of all the grains - about a 23, brown rice is about a 50 or so.

I cut the recipe in half..too be honest..I wanted it...to take a picture (unable to figure out how) lol.

135387,197023,5,1,"Thank you for posting this recipe, PanNan.  I hadn‚Äôt made carrot latkes before, but when I read through the ingredients this recipe really appealed to me, and I was not disappointed.  I made the latkes with some deliciously sweet baby carrots, and I added 4 cloves of garlic, minced, instead of the ¬Ω clove.  Next time I make these, I‚Äôll probably double the garlic.  I didn‚Äôt have any matzo meal on hand, so I used wheat germ, which worked out fine.  In order to reduce the fat content, I followed chia‚Äôs instructions ‚Äì for baked latkes recipe #48494 ‚Äì and baked the latkes in the oven.  And then everyone enjoyed them with sour cream ‚Äì also reduced fat.  Absolutely delicious!  I‚Äôve been asked to make them again.",2005-09-05
135387,129201,5,1,These were a big hit at dinner tonight. I did add 2 cloves of garlic and used breadcrumbs in place of the matzo meal - I also reduced the amount of oil to just a couple of tablespoons.

266651,286566,5,1,I scaled this back to 1/2lb almonds (using 200g just under the half) and because the marinade mix was so little I used the mortar and pestle and then threw in the almonds to marinate for their 30 minutes but I had to take my oven (fan forced) back to 125 degree C (from the equivelent 150C/300F) and they only needed a final 15 minutes and they are deliciously spicy and oh so moorish (hard to stop at a few) and so much better than the commercial spicy nuts and work out cheaper to make my own.

344863,1802613060,4,1,I used 4 egg whites instead of whole eggs to save on cholesterol. I was surprised at how fluffy they were without any baking powder to make them rise.These are great but they stuck to my greased skillet very badly but I had it on medium high instead of medium heat.  Also you are saving in carbs but if you put maple syrup on top you are gaining carbs. 53 g carbs in 1/4 cup of maple syrup. You have to put something on these because they are so very dry. So look up maple pancake syrup (low-carb) by beach girl on food.com and there is a recipe that is easy and only 1.7 g per 1/4 cup.,2014-11-08

I wanted to update...I make this often (my fiance is my husband now :-))and only changed it slightly by adding a splash of sherry to the onions to deglaze the pan. We sometimes eat this with Colmans mustard which is a bit spicy, sometimes I smear the stk with dijon and sometimes I add some dijon to the onion mixture after the sherry, depends on my mood.

I put the cornflakes in a ziploc to crush them, then added the melted butter and shook til evenly coated.  There was no probelm with the coating adhering to the chicken after it was dipped in the egg as I pressed it firmly and it stuck great!  This chicken cooks up tender and moist and the outside is crunchy delicious!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe that will be repeated here many times over!",2008-11-08
328726,627990,5,1,"My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. It's so easy and comes out moist and flavorful. I pounded the chicken breasts so they were of uniform thickness, and had plenty of crunch. Also, I ate mine with a small bowl of honey to dip it in, my husband had his with ranch dressing, and my son had his with honey-mustard. It was still very good without any sauces though. Thanks!",2008-12-19

There wasn't too much zing, but probably would be a hit with small kids. One other problem was that the bottoms were very moist and runny, so I lost the crunch and coating down there. I HAD NOT used frozen breast. It breaks my heart to give a so-so review, but I have to be honest.",2009-01-09
328726,291292,5,1,We have been making Cornflake Chicken since the late 90's. It is easy and delicious. We use different Mrs Dash seasoning blends to change the flavor. We also Butterfly the chicken breasts. Always turns out great!,2009-01-10

328726,2606864,4,1,"My family and I really like this version. I find crushing the cornflakes in a large bowl with my hands is a lot faster and easier than crushing inside a ziplock bag. I also like to use extra melted butter in the crushed cornflakes, and I also add plenty of seasoning to the cornflake mixture. I really like using a smokehouse maple seasoning with it. I&#039;ll rub it on the chicken, then apply the cornflakes. Usually bake about 45 minutes at 400. Comes out juicy. Our kids love it with mac n cheese.",2014-07-17

I salvaged what I had by putting the remaining cornflakes on top, then melting three more tablespoons of butter and drizzling that on top. I have made similar recipes in the past, so I knew it would also turn out better if I used a dish instead of a flat panel, which is what I did. I covered the pan with foil for 25 minutes, then took it off for the rest of the time and it turned out moist and delicious.

56969,351687,3,0,"Good baked beans. I made them for a get together with the neighbors this weekend. 

I made these again for a little league bbq.  I didn't have any onion or onion powder or flakes but I did have a Lipton Onion soup packet.  I put that in for the chopped up onion and it turned out fine.  I think this will be ""the"" baked bean recipe around here. I am going to start cutting up the bacon prior to putting it in the oven.  People are pushing it off to the side.  (I think if they were in the privacy of their own home they'd take that piece of bacon and gobble it up! ha) We have a lot of cookouts and parties to go to this summer.  This is easy to make and one that I will have memorized shortly!

Thanks Dave!",2007-06-03
56969,62086,4,1,"Very good beans!  I made the recipe as directed, including the brand of beans.  The only thing I would change as some others have said is to cut down on the brown sugar, as it was just a bit too sweet for me.  My Favorite BBQ sauce is Sweet Baby Rays, and being that the sauce is sweet and adding the sugar it was just a bit over the top for me.  I like my beans both sweet and spicy, so I added a few shakes of tabasco sauce and it gave a nice kick to it.  Will make again with the sugar change.",2007-06-06

I do wish I would have tried the recipe first before making it for so many people because one batch feeds  more than five.  I didn't think about it until I opened 40 cans of baked beans and 5 crock pots later that a serving is almost one whole can of beans and that is before adding all the other ingredients!

I fried it, removed all the fat, then used a tiny bit of the grease, with olive oil, to saute the onions.  I used canned white navy beans, instead of VanCamps or other brands of pork and beans. I rinsed them well, thereby reducing quite alot of the sodium content.  I used a BBQ sauce called &#039;Sweet &amp; Smoky&#039;.  MMmmmmmm..this was the hit of the dinner.

I'd have to say less oil also.  And it did need some salt for me.  Maybe I'll try some  parmesan as Sugarpea said and see what that does for this dish, as I think it just needs a little something else.  Love the heat from the red pepper, perfect!!

337614,724631,4,1,"These tasted fine, but were cold on serving because the directions said to let stand at least 10 minutes before serving. This recipe was not very forgiving for me. I substitued Campari tomatoes, which are arriving in better quality than Romas, but I learned that most of a Campari is liquid and seeds, the outer shell of the tomato is rather thin. When I simmered the tomato with the garlic, there was a lot of outliying olive oil. It turned out my chicken required extra time to compensate for incomplete thawing, so this was difficult to serve hot together. I cooked the (slightly thawed) frozen sliced French-style green beans for the lowest time listed, 7 minutes, but the green beans seemed over done to my preference.

Would make a great dip too if you cut back on the water.  I love how little oil is in this, but still rich from the almonds.  I need a dressing to inspire me to make salad sometimes (lazy me), and this absolutely did.  I followed your suggestion and ground up the almonds first, then threw the rest of the ingredients in - easy peasy.  Thanks for posting!!

Only change I made was using 2 cans of chopped Italian stewed tomatoes, with the juice, adding small, sliced portobello mushrooms and fresh baby spinach.  I did not put in orzo but had rotini for those that wanted pasta.  Everyone was going back for seconds and thirds!  The parmesan on top makes it truly Italian!  I will be making this in the next week to put up in containers for cold weather, will add white kidney beans instead of pasta.  I bet it would be great over small tortellini also!  Its definitely a recipe worth trying!",2014-10-22

I subbed pineapple juice for the OJ &amp; also added crushed pineapple to the top of the ham as I continued to douse it w/the glaze. It&#039;s amazing how different things look when you use a product from another geographic area. I used a boneless rolled Bayonne Skinka, the French equivalent of a boneless US ham. While highly touted as the &quot;champagne of hams&quot;, I have never agreed until now &amp; always found them dry. This was excellent &amp; the best outcome I&#039;ve had w/a Bayonne ham.

The only thing I did slightly different was that I used to different pans and made his using the shrimp, and mine using cubed chicken breasts (I cannot eat seafood (allergic). I did hold off on adding the garlic to mine for a few minutes, because the cubed chicken takes longer to cook than the shrimp (I started my pan first, and added the garlic when I started his).

Loved how the smokey flavor of the cumin laced the syrup with support from the ginger and, in my case, Splenda brown sugar,   In reading the recipe, I thought 1/2 pound of carrots per person seemed like a lot but 2 of us did indeed eat an entire pound (half recipe).  My only real comment other than accolades was that the carrots were cooked to our satisfaction at 18 minutes, tender but with a little crisp to them.  For those who don't like their veggies too soft, pay attention.

Since I have Mediterranean blood I love using my hands to eat any food, so I didn't have a problem eating the mussels.  However hubby he isn't really a hands on person when it comes to food.  So I served his differently,  I scooped up a bowl of steam rice, then poured the broth around the rice and served the mussels (without shell) on top of the rice.

Everyone makes it everyone loves it. At first I disliked it but the stuff grows on you. My fianc&eacute; and two children along with myself moved to Iowa a few months back and I wanted to make it. Realized while at the store I never cooked it... I followed the ingredients and directions. It came out watered down and lacking flavor of the sausage. I called my mother and grandmother and they both told me you're suppose to add the sausage at the end once the beans have broken down and thickened up. Put it all in the pot with all the drippings and let it simmer for another 30 mins. While the directions where fairly accurate (I will use it for reference in the future) but I also highly suggest adding the meat in last as the cookie time breaks down the fats and leave it somewhat bland.

I also used whole wheat bread, and assumed that the can of salmon was the 16 oz size, not the smaller, tuna sized can. Since I don't have any cooking spray I simply brushed the olive oil on the bread and the pan, which worked perfectly. Other wise I followed the directions that resulted in a perfectly puffy and scrumptious dinner.  I think I'll be using this recipe as a jumping off place to get creative with other fillings and am toying with the idea of a vegetarian version.  Mirj this is another good one!",2006-01-07

I made these for a Halloween Party at the kids' nutfree school, so I could not use almonds for nails; instead I used some red icing thinned with water. I know - bread and icing don't really go together but as far as I'm concerned - when Halloween comes around the ghosts enter the kitchen and weird things are known to happen. The fingers were a bit time consuming, because I had to re-shape them after they had been in the oven for 5 min. The dough puffed up so much that you could barely see any knuckles or nail impressions I had made, so after 5 min I removed the fingers and redid the forming of nails and knuckles. I would say that you can easily stretch this recipe to 40-50 breadsticks if you want long snarly fingers; mine sort of came out a bit like giants' fingers because the dough rose quit a bit while baking. Next time I would make the fingers longer and skinnier. Oh yes - the flavour :) was great, too!

I used all of the ingredients in each layer, even the kids who while they like lasagne don't like the riccotta, and by the time they pick it out half of their piece is left on the plate, not this time they took healthy pieces, and ate it all, using my homemade bread to get every bite.

I found this and it came out exactly how I remembered :) I gave this recipe 5 stars but I did make a slight adjustment. After it was done in my ice cream maker I added about 6 oz. of roughly chopped white chocolate chunks then froze it. As for ""carriage princess"" I'm a little confused...1/4 teaspoon of salt is a tiny amount. I didn't even taste any salt with my finished product. I'm thinking maybe some of the rock salt may have seeped into your mix while it was freezing in the ice cream maker..?? I kept my ice and salt level low and away from the lid. Since the recipe doesn't make alot, there was no chance of it accidentally getting into my mix (which sadly I've done before). Hope this helps others because my fiance and I LOVED the way this came out...Thank you for a great recipe ""ratherbeswimmin""!!",2012-04-17
434398,41551036,5,1,Tried this recipe today and absolutely loved it! :) Like another reviewer I also added more chopped white chocolate at the last minute of the churning process and it turned out amazing! The salt amount doesn&#039;t seem much to me. I don&#039;t understand what the problem was that the other reviewer encountered.... maybe she used kosher salt or something like that that might not have blended in as it should? I dont know. I used regular table salt and you can&#039;t taste any of it. :) I also made this using my kitchenaid ice cream maker attachment :) super easy and delicious!

I patted the dough into rectangles and rolled up tucking the ends under and baked on a cornmeal coated baking sheet. The crust is nice and crispy/chewy. There is one small thing I will do differently next time and that is to brush with egg white just before baking vs before the second rise. It doesn't say to do this but I covered the loaves for the second rise and my egg wash all but disappeared into the towel I used to cover the loaves. Maybe I shouldn't have covered them but 30 minutes seemed like a long time to let the bread stand without being covered. Thank you for sharing :),2009-11-22

And I like it, it&#039;s very good indeed, but falls just short of five-star-worthy. I would suggest using good-quality canned Italian tomatoes (like San Marzano), diced and VERY well-drained, if making this when fresh tomatoes are out of season; the greenhouse ones available in winter have zero flavor. Also, the pepper jack cheese needs to be really hot---mine didn&#039;t seem to be, so I added some minced fresh jalapeno to up the heat. When/if I make this again, I may try subbing fresh cilantro for the basil.

One of my eggs was small, so i added an extra egg.

My only addition is that I make about a cup of creamy glaze that I pipe on top after the rolls are cooled.  The amount of filling to spread on each triangle comes out to be about 1 tablespoon.  I have made them several times and have never been disappointed.  Next time, I may toast some sliced almonds and add them on top of the glaze.  Thanks, Manami!",2009-01-03

I enjoyed some with egg salad and a green salad.  The only thing I struggle with is my head that says, ""this salty biscuit has a sweet-cookie texture"".  I am wondering if they could be made even thinner and bake just a little crispier so my head will say, ""ah, this is in the cracker category, not salty cookie category.""
I love the whole grain in it and may just try them again, slightly thinner.  I've made something like this, but rolled out thin in oats before baking, so it'd likely work.

88416,693345,5,1,"I made this today for a small BBQ lunch that I had, because my mother-in-law is diabetic, and I didn't want her to be left out of the desserts (because I made other ice creams for everyone else). I used 1 cup whipping cream and 3 1/2 cups fat-free half and half (using all fat-free half and half might be more like ice milk, I think). All the other ingredients I kept the same. I changed the mixing method a bit though, based on other experiences I've had with custard-based ice creams: I simmered the Splenda, cream, and half and half in a heavy saucepan, until it was hot, stirring with a whisk to dissolve the Splenda (the mixture foamed up a bit while heating). I beat the eggs in a separate bowl, and added a little of the hot mixture to the eggs, to temper them, before adding the eggs to the saucepan. I then cooked until medium-thick on low heat (don't let it boil, or the eggs will scramble). Once it was medium-thick, I took it off the heat, poured it through a strainer into a large bowl, let it cool a bit, and stirred in the vanilla. I then proceeded with step 4. I had to make this in 2 batches in the ice cream maker, because my Cuisinart ice cream maker only has a 1 1/2 quart bowl, and it was too much liquid to put in one go. I made two batches (totaling about 1 3/4 quarts finished), and I chopped up some sugar-free Mounds-type candy for one of the batches. I didn't have any, but my mother-in-law said it was good and the texture was nice. I was happy to be able to make ice cream that she could eat too.

We found that for the amount of risotto this recipe makes, 24 mussels wasn't quite enough to go around.  I actually got about 30 mussels, and we still felt like there could have been more.  I make mussels quite often, and I usually serve them in the shell.  Perhaps the mussels ""in the shell"" give the illusion that there are more.

I also take dried apricots and poach them for about 20 min. in about 1/2 cup sugar and 1 cup water with a few TBS of orange liquor.  I then melt a little white chocolate and dip the poached apricots in it and place them on top of the torte so that each slice gets one.  It just makes it that much more decadent.  Also, if you have a spring-form pan that would be the pan I would suggest as it makes it easier to get out.",2004-03-15

I improvised on a few ingred. so I did not have to go back to the grocery store.

353989,496803,4,1,"I used 8 inch square wrappers, and got 20 rolls from the batch, with enough filling left to make one more (but no more wrappers). I wanted to give this 5 stars, as the flavor of the filling was just outstanding! The more I thought about it, though, there are several things that I would tweek, just a little. First, I loved the flavor of the shitakes, but wished there was a little more, so I would up the quantity from 6 to 8. Second, the noodles really need to be cut into smaller pieces in order to mix the filling well. I had a few rolls that were mostly noodle, and a few that had nearly none. Cutting into smaller pieces would fix this. Third, while you mention drying the vegetable mixture before adding to the bowl, I'd do the same for the chicken and shrimp mixture. There was more liquid than I expected in the pan when these were done, and I found it when I got to filling the last of the rolls. Lastly, While I appreciate the lower fat benefit of baking these, I think the texture of the wrapper would really be better if they were deep fried. Overall, I really enjoyed the recipe, and plan to make it again. Thanks for posting!",2009-02-20

It doesn't melt all the way but prevents the tomatoes from making the crust soggy.  I wait till the crust cools before I put the tomatoes in it.The other 1/2 of the cheese goes in the mayo.

73921,6357,5,1,"I love you for posting this recipe!! These cookies are awesome! There was just 1 substitute I used, i.e., I used margarine as a substitute for shortening. Also, I was short on butter; so I used 5 tbsps. of melted(NOT SOFTENED) butter and for the remaining 7 tbsps, I used melted(NOT SOFTENED) margarine. This is such a wonderful recipe to work with, especially the part where after refrigerating the dough you remove it from the refrigerator, the dough is so firm like as though it was some bread---before cutting out various shapes, I sliced the dough and oh my, it was simply so good; it gave me the feeling that it was a loaf of bread that I was slicing! LOL:)
EVERYONE who tasted these cookies asked for the recipe! I was 'COOKIE QUEEN' at the Halloween party I took these to. What an Honour, all thanks due to you! I shaped this dough into very unusual shapes(all born out of my mind). There were some twisted fingers, some bent fingers, some ghost rabbits, some half moons, some haunted trees with leaves, some long noses, some which I joint together to shape into a haunted house with a window missing, some which I shaped into faces with an eye missing! LOL. I've had such fun with this recipe I can't even begin to tell you. I wish I had the patience to click a snap to tell you what I mean. These cookies are great on their own too(i.e. without the nutella icing). The children enjoyed this with the icing, ofcourse, while the bigger children(my mom and dad included!) said they just loved the burst of black pepper flavour in this and they had these without the icing. My mom had some secretly too! (She is on a diet but this awesome recipe made her cheat!) This treat is now on going to be on my cookie tray for every Halloween!

I was surprised that you could not taste the black pepper, it was not peppery hot like I thought it would be, just nice and spicy.

I subbed pork and beans for the chili beans as that is what I had on hand. I added in 2 tblsp. of chili sauce to make up for the difference. My husband has a thing about cumin so left it out and decreased the chili powder due to using the chili sauce. I thought it needed a little colour so added in about 1/2 cup of frozen corn which turned out to be a nice addition. I topped the servings with sour cream. My son thought it was a bit spicy but ate his serving, my husband and I both thought it was great.

I browned the chicken chunks in 3 separate batches so that it actually browned instead of steamed.  I used fresh sage from the garden and did not use the nuts.  This makes a lovely juice at the end.  Cooked for 50 minutes.  Hubby and I enjoyed it so much, we devoured the whole lot!  This could also work as a side dish or vegetarian meal by omitting the chicken and using veggie stock cubes.  Perhaps a sprinkling of cheese on top would be nice too. I will definitely be making this often.  Thanks Wendy-Bob!",2007-10-27

Unlike the OP, I LOVE eggplant. Like others, I usually dice a small eggplant and measure the amount i have, then add proportionate amount of potatoes and double the spices (except for the cayenne). Following the recipe Ms. Jaffrey gave it takes a while to get the potatoes done, so I usually microwave them with about 1/3 cup water till just barely cooked (about 2.5 - 3 min), before adding to the skillet. I LIKE my eggplant very tender, so I do cook it to that point. I have also added cauliflower to the dish, without omitting any thing, and it comes out fine.   

Making this recipe with a whole eggplant and proportionate amount of potatoes makes a huge skillet full.  Left-overs are fantastic as a filling in omlettes and fritattas, mixed into upma(an Indian breakfast dish) or rice, or just reheated and served in a wrap. Or saute some tomato, onion, ginger/garlic paste till the tomato is cooked then add left overs to that for an entirely new dish!

I am rating much more than 5 stars...I marinated the chicken overnight as stated, and baked it early the following morning, we  had it for yesterday's dinner in the evening, great blend of flavors, I just love dishes with olives in them, I did use more garlic than called for (about 2 tablespoons!), otherwise, made as directed...we loved it, thanks for sharing another winner CL, I will make this again!...Kittencal:)",2004-07-29

There are changes that can be made easily to suit your taste and I usually top it with grated parmesan or cheddar.  Also add black olives because my husband loves them.

My only suggestion: is that you remember to keep the crossaints in the refrigerator until the moment you need the dough, otherwise the dough gets too warm and unwieldly.  My husband thought they were like little pot pies and I thought the left-overs tasted pretty good the next day.  I used green onion instead of regular onion, and I thought it tasted wonderful.  I also added a pinch of chili powder and garlic to give it a little kick.  Thanks for the great recipe!!",2002-06-17

I did the bacon different from the recipe, cooked the bacon first, alone, drained the fat, then added the mushrooms, onion and I added 1 chopped jalepeno pepper and used the dill. I was surpized at how much the frittata puffed up under the broiler, with the potatoes in it; I had thought it might be quite heavy, not so, light and fluffy!

25219,44383,5,1,This turned out great. Hubby and I had it for dinner the other night with toast and it was perfectly light but filling.  The only thing I did differently was use canned potatoes and hubby commented that a little less potato would be good. Also I used ready-made bacon strips so the time involved cooking this went down to just about nothing!  I had enough left over for breakfast the next day and the frittata reheats in the microwave real nice.  It's a keeper. Great Recipe! Thanks!,2003-11-12

The family gobbled up her frittata and the smile on her face was worth 5 stars!  She did opt to use 8 oz of sliced mushrooms and increased the cheese to TWO cups - whoops.  The increase in the mushrooms was great but two cups of cheese was a bit over the top.  Thanks for the recipe and the time with my daughter!,2005-08-10
25219,47907,5,1,What a great breakfast!  I think next time I will leave out the olive oil since the bacon makes plenty of grease ~ which I drained after it was cooked.  I used just salt and pepper.  It came out wonderfully!  Thanks for posting a keeper!,2006-02-19
25219,265954,5,1,"Just delicious.  I tweaked a bit by dicing the potatoes and frying them for a few minutes instead of boiling, then I added the chopped onion, bacon and Cubanelle pepper, instead of the mushrooms.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for posting.",2007-10-16

I didn't have bacon so I used some cooked italian meatballs that I had left over and chopped them up and put them in the pan at the time you put in bacon; I didn't have mushrooms either.  I doubled the potatoes, eggs and cheese.  I also used a mixture of dill, rosemary, oregano and terragon because they were the spices I had used in the meatballs.

152284,38574,5,1,Fabulous.  I didn't have onion powder so I used some jarred garlic.  Doubled the sauce recipe using 3/4 c honey and 1 tsp curry powder.  I didn't read my directions well and dumped all the sauce over the tenders before putting the oven and it turned out perfectly.  DH suggested using the sauce on wings.  Yummmmm.....,2008-01-08
152284,331557,4,1,This was good and I will make it again.  I did double the curry spice and am glad I did as it may have been a bit bland for our tastes otherwise.  I also used about half the onion powder and then added fresh onions which went lovely with the sauce.  In the future I will add fresh garlic as well as I always try to use fresh instead of powders.  I served this with recipe #73708 and recipe #196658 and it was a tasty meal.  My boyfriend loved this dinner (which I made for Easter Sunday).  Thanks for posting!,2008-03-23

I just wanted drop biscuits; the muffin tin effect wasn't for me, so I just dropped them onto a baking sheet and 12 minutes later I had just the biscuits I'd been craving.  I used margarine and 2.5% milk, and halved the recipe for 6 perfect biscuits.  Will make again!  Thank you very much for sharing!",2012-10-01
16851,2455693,4,1,Thanks for this recipe! My family requested biscuits with dinner and I had nothing.

420390,2001063206,5,1,"Decided to try this with all of the fresh summer ingredients we have in MI right now. I ended up using peppered bacon and skipped the chili paste in the salsa. My family LOVED it! Not only is it beautiful, but delicious and healthy. It would be very simple to make this gluten free by substituting the flour with almond flour (1/2 cup btw- I had to convert a few things since this is from Australia :) The corn fritters were a little challenging, but worth the effort- delicious! We are going to make the avocado salsa again this week as a side dish! I served this for dinner with BLT's on yummy bread and added pesto to the mayo to kick it up a bit.",2016-07-11

I followed the directions for mixing and really think the processer step for blending half of it is a must. Where I did go a little different was in the frying, decided to deep fry, dropping the dough by the spoonful into the hot oil, the end result was light, fluffy inside with a delightful crisp outside. One of the best recipes I've made lately. Thanks for posting",2016-07-20

I really wanted to love it as written.Thanx for posting.",2007-02-10
177783,169430,4,1,"This really hit the spot tonight. I used plain fat free yogurt in place of the mayo and mustard and 1 tsp of Splenda for the sugar. I discovered that my tarragon was among the things now buried in the garage. I thought after dinner that some mint would be nice in this. I have half left and will add some to that. I agree that raisins would be a good addition but then the sugars would climb. I didn't feel that any salt was needed. This was perfect for a summer sandwich meal. It was creamy, crunchy and refreshing.",2007-08-02
177783,133174,4,1,This has a nice fresh taste.  The dressing is very light and refreshing.  I did not have the tarragon so I used savory and omitted the salt.  DH said he would prefer a higher apple to celery ratio.  This was served on a bed of baby arugula.,2007-09-03

I realized, though, I'd FORGOTTEN the dried beef, so I used crisp bacon I ran thru the food processor. I think it worked great. I love the salty flavor of the green olive in this.

I chilled the cheese mixture for about an hour to make it easier to shape into balls. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks ms_bold!",2006-06-06
77966,179133,5,1,Made these for a catering job and they were great! Very salty but a good counter to the sweet stuff we had. Yielded 25 balls for me (not 30) but some probably could've been a touch smaller. Used pretzel sticks stuck in each one instead of toothpicks. Thanks for the recipe ms_bold!,2006-10-13
77966,47907,5,1,This is very similar to a cheeseball that I make occasionally ~ I love how simple and easy these are to make but packed with flavor. They looked great on the table at our Open House and everyone enjoyed them ~ much easier than a cheeseball.  Thank you for posting!,2007-03-29

Even though I did make some changes, I am posting this rating because I am convinced that if I followed the directions exactly, it would have to be a 5* rating!  I did use Cool Whip to mix with the marshmallows.  I used a pre-made graham cracker pie crust.  I melted the butter and dissolved the icing sugar in the melted butter.  I basted the pie crust with the melted butter/sugar mixture.  I then layered the Cool Whip mixture and cherry pie filling as directed.  It was delicious!  I would recommend the melted butter/sugar mixture when using any pie recipe that calls for a pre-made graham cracker pie crust!  Thanks SooZee!  This is so easy and definitely a keeper!",2006-04-17

22211,1383047,5,1,I made these at work using their microwave and lunch room. A fun and jolly treat everyone enjoyed. Super quick to make if you aren't too fussy. I'd melt the bark in the microwave and just dip the pretzels in by fork. Then place onto a coated paper plate with or without wax paper. Most would be gone before I could sprinkle sparkles onto them. And look for the wonderful different shapes of pretzels. Trees this time of year and squares are cute even. Trees are my favorite all year round due to living in far NW Montana right among them. A pine cone shape would be fun too but never saw one. Any pretzel pretty much works except the huge sizes. Make some in chocolate too. Or half and half. A dash of green food color to the white bark for tree shaped ones add some holiday zip. Thanks for sharing Darlene,2011-12-06

   I put the onions, olives and pickles in the food processor and chopped them up and put the eggs thru a strainer to have a fine consistancy when they were mixed in. The result was a beautiful salad that when garnished with the egg slices and some fine diced green onion and seasoned salt (I was out of paprika )was almost to pretty to eat.   I will be making this again soon.",2002-06-10

My kids complained about the spicyness, so I guess next time I will cut the chili powder by half. Personally, hubby and I liked that. Presentation is not very good, as the zucchini all by itself after marinating for a long time looks pretty drab.

213385,351811,5,1,"I loved this recipe. It had just the right tweaks... tastes blended well. I love Ceviche and Gazpacho and this is the best of both combined. Great flavor!

213385,808373,5,1,"Excellent recipe!!  I had a Shrimp Gazpacho salad at a local restaurant in town and couldn't wait to try making it at home.  This recipe was the perfect one, love all the flavors!!  Skipped the tequila when I made it, because of our son - but would love to try it again with.  Thanks for sharing!!",2010-09-10
58030,119422,4,1,This was pretty good. My family voted to give it four stars. The only thing I did different was use a whole chicken so we had more meat. Also we added avocado to the toppings. Thanks for sharing!,2006-04-22
110881,73836,5,1,"These are really really really good!  I made them this weekend as my in laws are visiting, using some of my precious North American Peanut Butter hoard.  Lovely moist cupcakes, with a great peanut butter flavor, and the icing is to die for.  Thanks!",2005-06-05
12367,50778,5,1,"Your mother was a good and wise woman.  

Made these tonight as DH wanted something sweet and oatmeal-y.  This fit the bill- it was also easy to make and clean up (which I liked).  Made this with raspberry preserves.  Next time I might add a dash of cinnamon and a sprinkle of pecans (if I'm feeling up to that much bother).  ; ) 

Thank you for a lovely new addition to my cookbook.",2003-06-17
12367,22655,5,1,Excellent! I used cherry preserves and they were dynamite! Make sure you pat the mixture firmly and cool completely OR they will fall apart on you. ,2003-07-21
12367,48956,5,1,"We love oatmeal around our house and this is a good change from oatmeal cookies.  Since I was not completely sure about what preserves were, I opted to use strawberry jam on one half and on the other half I used frozen blueberries sprinkled with sugar.  Then as recipe stated, sprinkled reserved oatmeal mixture on top.  The result was fabulous.  I'm holding onto this recipe!",2003-07-24
12367,142658,5,1,"Thanks for posting, I had a recipe similar but lost it, and I did not have a cake mix to make it with, so I tried this one.  I used only 1 1/2 sticks butter and I added a dash of cinnamon.  Used raspberry - our favorite, and only thing I had.  Great!!! YUM, YUM, YUM!!!  Super easy, and with staple ingredients too!!!!!",2004-08-09

12367,174338,4,1,"This recipe is fabulous!  If you're going to serve it straight out of the oven - I recommend baking the bottom ""crust"" first to make it crunchy, then spreading preserve and crumbles and rebaking for just toasting the crumbles.  But I made mine with fresh apple slices, tons of cinnamon and apple jam!  So delicious - I agree with the others, this treat only gets better with time~~~  Thanks so much!!!",2005-06-01
12367,168896,5,1,i was looking for a recipe that would take care of my craving for the starbuck's apricot bar which sells for 2.00 a piece for a very small piece by the way.  i tried this and it was just as good if not better.  i didnt have apricot so i used my daughter's organic wholekids strawberry jam.  very tasty; super easy to make and when i make it again i'll use a few walnuts as well.  thanks for the recipe.,2006-07-24
12367,68884,4,1,These are very tasty and disappeared when I took them to work. My lone complaint - spreading the preserves (I used blackberry) on the oat mixture is messy; the preserves kept picking up loose bits of oat & flour and not wanting to spread well. I was really afraid I'd made a mess! But the flavor is really good.,2007-02-02
12367,364685,5,1,"DBF makes a pan of these every week to eat for breakfast and for an after-dinner snack. I take one every once in a while, so I can verify that they are yummy. He changes up the preserves each week and, so far, apricot is my favorite. He will occasionally use sugar-free preserves. I don't like these variations because these preserves take on a slightly rubbery texture. I made these once to help out and i accidentally left out the baking soda (There are reasons I don't usually bake). They were significantly denser, but there was no adverse effect on the taste. DBF actually liked them better this way and now no longer adds the soda, although this makes the bars slightly more crumbly.",2007-03-11
12367,508459,5,1,"Made a batch of these yesterday, great oatmeal bars!  I added two tablespoons of golden syrup to the mixture to help bind it all together and this worked really well.  Will definitely be making these delicious bars again! Thanks for a great recipe.",2007-07-09

I can assure that these little gems will not last long. Very easy to make and so perfect for the Fall and Winter holidays (or just because you want them at anytime). Have you picked up on the fact that they are highly addicting? Thanks so very much for sharing this one Lazy (I think!, lol)",2012-11-03

Out of necessity, I made a few substitutions/changes. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly and fear that it may be even better. FYI, recipe still works great with walnuts, maple syrup substituted for vanilla, and without allspice.",2016-12-14
12367,706608,5,1,"These are great! Highly recommended to anyone. I halved the recipe this time and it halved very well in a 9x9 (my 13x9 has disappeared on me) I used strawberry preserves on one side and apricot on the other (great recipe to have everyone add what they want to their ""section"" of the pan) Both are great! Next time I may try spreading a thin layer of peanut butter down before the preserves :) Thanks for a great, easy and cheap treat! And yes these do hold together well for transport. Will make again for sure.",2009-03-10

These are so good and were such a big hit that I have been making them every year. I too found it hard to spread the preserves without disturbing the bottom layer so I just add more, just enough to cover the bottom and it works every time.",2014-12-20
144073,209603,5,1,well this was just delicious. i made it for a potluck and it got demolished. i made it again for just us and i sprinkled  parmasean cheese on it when i took the foil off for the last 10 min and it was soo good. thanks for a great recipe that i will be making again!!,2006-12-19
144073,283390,5,1,"I loved this! The texture is so great...very creamy and soft. The onions are very good in this, and I recommend you saute them for a long time in the full amount of butter (I don't think this would be as good if the onions were still crunchy).

I sliced my potatoes pretty thin, since I have experience cooking potatoes in an open fire (some times it can take for ever).

In fact, they asked for the recipe.",2001-03-24

7435,16006,0,0,"This recipe sounds delicious, and I'm definitely going to use it next time I make corned beef.  Just a thought---Mom was Boston-bred Irish and swore that whenever you cooked corned beef, you should always put it in plain water with a tablespoon of cider vinegar; bring to a boil and then discard the water.  Supposedly this cuts the grease that the meat gives off during the actual cooking.  Anybody else ever heard this?",2001-08-21

I found the other veggies to be a bit bland though.  Next year, when we make this recipe, we will try putting all the seeds into an infusion ball (a mesh ball used by loose tea drinkers) so we don't have to pick them off the veggies and meat.

7435,121581,5,1,"There was a depth to the flavor of this corned beef that I have never experienced before. My DD preferred the way I usually did it with water and the little spice packet that comes with the corned beef; but the folks at the pot-luck where I took it this time thought it was fabulous.  A bit more work and a bit more expensive, but worth it if you want a bit richer end product.",2005-02-15

7435,793633,5,1,"I mostly followed this recipe, and it was outstanding.  Everyone commented on how flavorful and the beef, cabbage and carrots were.  Here's what I did differently:

1) omitted the malt vinegar because I don't like it;
2) added the carrots and cabbage for the last 45 minutes of cooking so that they didn't overcook;
3) Upped the Guiness to a full cup (8 oz.);
4) after removing the beef from the broth to cut off the fat, I coated it with a mixture of brown sugar, apple juice, Dijon mustard, and bourbon, and placed the beef in a 400 F oven for 10 minutes to glaze it.  Simmered the additional glaze and served it on the side instead of horseradish and mustards.
5) potatoes were not cooked along with the beef, but instead were roasted separately at 425 F with olive oil and Penzey's Spices Fox Point Seasoning -- absolutely delicious;
6) most important note: put the spices in a tea ball infuser so that you don't have loose spices floating around everywhere; it's not pleasant to bit into a whole coriander seed!",2008-03-18
7435,561012,5,1,"Kevin, you are so right!! This is the best corned beef EVER.  My husband and I liked it so much I will never make it again without vinegar and guiness!  I substituted seasoned rice vinegar for malt since I had it on hand.. and wow... absolutely spectacular.",2008-03-18

I used mesclun salad leaves with mixed herbs and some extra basil. This was a sophisticated and delightful salad with lots of layers of flavours. The lemon marinade was the star of the show for the chicken fillets and the conbination of flavours for the salad was wonderful. Enjoyed on the terrace today with a glass of chardonnay!

I believe it was ""Cliff House"" chowder that this recipe attempts to emulate. In either case I have had both ""Cliff House"" clam chowder, and ""Chart House"" clam chowder, and this could be a great deal closer to both.

I added chopped pecans to the topping and might add pecans to the cake itself next time. A wonderful Sunday breakfast on a cold day with a cup of joe, the smell of cinnamon wafting through the house.

It baked perfectly in a glass pan - 350 degrees for 35 min. To set the center, I turned off the oven and let the coffee cake stay in for an additional 5 minutes. It came out perfectly.

225416,2001052901,5,1,"This recipe is an easy and tasty way to use up sourdough starter. I make it quite often and each time my family loves it. I've tweaked with and played with the recipe a couple times. Often times making them into muffins and then trying different toppings on them to see which we like best. However all are devoured. Some recipe tweaks I particularly love is mixing up the topping. I find the included topping dense and sinks into pocketed bits of melted butter and sugar. Which is good, but I enjoy a streusel toppin with a bit of crunchiness. So I'll make a mix, using melted butter/sugar/flour/cinnamon. Then use this topping on top. Yes, I'm sure it's terrible for you. But this is a treat, so indulge. Once I tried a decorative cream cheese glaze. I found that too sweet and didn't add much. Another time made a nutty streusel topping. Again, didn't add much for us. I think the best I've found is this topping with melted butter streusel topping in addition. I will make half the topping recipe, with half a streusel recipe. Also, when making into muffins, 15min or so bake time. Even in 8x8 pan, I find 25-30min bake time is good. Perhaps my oven runs hotter, but nonetheless I would suggest checking before the 35 min. 35 min seems to produce a pretty dry cake for me.",2016-11-25

I had neither wine nor household pet, so, in the interests of following the recipe reasonably closely, I went out and bought a cat. However, on my tight budget, made even tighter by my recent purchase, I had to make do with some methylated spirits ( White spirits for American readers), instead of the wine. I drank some of the Methylated, which tasted surprisingly good, so I had a little more whilst I cut crosses in all but one of the chestnuts as you suggested.
 
I heated the oven to the required temperature and put the chestnuts in a cast iron pan into the hot oven. 

Ahh... the deliciousness of anticipation! 

After about 15 or 20 minutes, the pressure inside the un-crossed chestnut built up enough pressure to explode the tough skin of the nut. 
It let go with all the force (and the exact same  physics  principle) that drives massive ships and railway carriages; the irresistible force of steam. The explosion of that single chestnut was heard by neighbours in the next street. Someone rang the fire and emergency services. I had no need to open the oven, as the force had blown the heatproof glass door right off its hinges. The oven cavity was covered in a very thin film of chestnut meat, but there was nothing else left of the exploded nut. I couldn't even find fragments of skin! 

It took days to clean up later, but I was quite calm throughout, as the Methylated spirits had soothed my nerves so much, that I just though it was funny, after I had recovered from the bowel-loosening shock of the unbelievably loud explosion made by the detonating chestnut.

After the ambulance officers had treated me for mild alcohol poisoning, and suggested that I never again try this chestnut-readiness testing method at home or anywhere else for that matter, they left, happily clutching a few of the remaining nuts, which, by the way, were delicious, with a touch of salt. I had almost forgotten about the chestnuts.

The cat?... He flew through an open window with a screech I will never forget. I have never seen that cat again.",2008-07-24

146220,706608,5,1,"Never knew the ""right"" way to make chestnuts and have tried just about everything on them in the past lol Used 2 cats + a sleeping father for foolproof timing and went with a nice bottle of Blackberry Merlot. I appreciate the tip about serving them out of a paper bag. Keeps them warm longer and adds a very nice old timey touch.",2009-01-06

I found it interesting that you called it Korean and yet referred to it as having Russioan origins.  I made it in the AM and let it marinade all day in the fridge all day.

Korean people use cotton seed oil for this salad.

66527,59686,5,1,"This is a ""good one dish meal"".
You could add one more chicken breast though, since there's plenty
of rice and broccli.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, and added more salt and pepper when I mixed the soup, milk rice, and broccoli together. The next time though, I'm gong to use a canned vegetable sray instead of the oil.  The oil splattered and made quite a mess.  I only used 1 3/4 cups of the minute rice, and substituted (6 ounces) of chopped broccoli for the 2 cups of broccoli florets.  I found this to be the right amount of rice and
broccoli for this recipe.  This is a good comfort kind of meal, but this is not a 15 minute meal to prepare.  Anna you have written that it took you 20 minutes to cook this meal.  I actually found it took 25 minutes, plus an extra 5 minutes to prep, so it was a 30 minute meal.  I just thought I'd bring this to your attention.  Thank-you for a nice ""one dish meal"" recipe.

66527,587766,0,0,i havent tried this recipe but i have a suggestion for those of you saying it took longer than 15 minutes to make.  try pounding the chicken breast with a mallet until its pretty thin....that will definately help cutting down on the cooking time.  good luck!,2008-04-22

DO not be put off by adding the honey and the rosemary to this recipe, they were the ingredients that really made these tarts special IMHO!!! I also made mine into ROUNDS instead of squares - using a Yorkshire Pudding tin.

In cooking, I put everything in the pot but the potatoes and cooked for 30 minutes, then I added the potatoes and cooked for 30 more minutes, until the potatoes were done.  After it cooled I then put in two freezer containers, being only two of us I didn't want to freeze the entire amt.

I first tried this using 3/4 cup of FRESHLY grated cheese, and it was very tasty. But then I tried the 2nd batch using 1/4 cup of that dry, grated parm that comes in the shaker bottle. That, too, was very tasty. I think the black pepper makes it really stand out. I will definately be making this again. P.S. The only thing I did differently was I had to use my electric popcorn popper because out gas stove is being repaired. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. Hubby and I enjoyed it very much!

It didn't form well (perhaps 3 cups is not enough flour and maybe 3 is too many eggs?) and it took longer to cook than the stated 20 minutes. I am a first time baker, and I was hoping for a fool proof recipe - but I found myself struggling. However, prior to making this I had made Recipe #329085 and it turned out beautifully (not to mention it was easy and delicious). From here on out, I will be using Mrs. Macnab's Scones for my foundation recipe and adding Monty's Spinach-Cheese Scones' additional ingredients from there.

Took it off the heat and added it to my baking dish. Mixed in the tuna tin tomato&#039;s and i used pasta sauce. This is where i added my own stuff to boost it a bit. While the pasta was cooking i added some capers, marinated olives ( I used tequila lime and chilli marinated ) frozen peas, green beans ( I blanched the beans and peas ) and a zucchini ( courgette ).

I didn't add the bacon, and  as delicious as I'm sure it is, I'm glad I didn't add it because this sandwich tastes really rich and really delicious without it. I added minced garlic in the cheese mixture, and used mozzarella & light mayo. It kind of tastes like a cheesy spinich dip. Thanks for a great recipe!!",2007-04-19
86350,227652,4,1,"This was delicious! It's getting 4 stars because the ingredient list wasn't very clear, and I can't imagine how this would serve only 2 people! I used reduced fat mozzarella cheese, fat free mayo (1 tbsp + 1 1/2 tsp for one person), spicy brown mustard, turkey bacon & a whole wheat tortilla instead of bread. I didn't use that much parmesan; the mozzarella was enough cheese for me! I cooked it like a quesadilla, folded over in a skillet-and added minced onion, garlic powder & oregano. I am a spice fiend! This was a lovely lunch & really did taste like spinach dip. I love the dip from Costco, but it is SO high in fat, so this was great to find. Thank u for sharing!",2008-01-17

I used what I had on hand:  grated gouda (instead of swiss), and whole wheat bread.  I added a clove of crushed garlic, and I grilled it on my George Foreman. I mixed everything together, and spread it on the bread.  My son, who's a bacon lover, looked at the recipe to verify its addition, and said was really great.  Thanks!",2009-03-06

For the meatless meats, I used Tofurkey&#039;s Artisan Andouille sausage (which is really good) and Beyond Meat&#039;s grilled chicken free strips (which is also my fave these days for chicken).  Unfortunately, we did not love this gumbo and found it to be a bit bland for our tastes.  It was just ok.  We tried to &quot;doctor&quot; it up after tasting it by adding celery salt (since it needed salt and there is no celery in this recipe, which most gumbos have), creole seasoning, gumbo file, and lots of hot pepper to taste.  This helped somewhat.  I looked back through my other reviews of gumbos that I made when I still ate meat to maybe put my finger on what we did not care for as much.  I noticed most of the recipes used very little, if any, tomato sauce, and perhaps it was the quantity of stewed tomatoes that diluted some of the other flavors?  Other recipes included celery, one included white wine, and several included more cajun or creole seasonings.  I am sure styles of gumbo are personal preference and perhaps many others enjoy theirs with more tomato flavor than we do.",2014-07-16

Replaced the caster sugar with 3 tablespoons of barley malt and reduced the yolks by one because of the liquidity of the malt.  This substitution gave me a confection quite different in taste and appearance from the original recipe. Barley malt is darker than honey and while sweet has a slightly smoky flavor, though nothing compared to molasses.

232764,767215,5,1,"Wonderful! I'm a coconut lover and always enjoy finding new coconut recipes. Because another reviewer said the cookies seemed not to be sweet enough, I used sweetened coconut instead of unsweetened. I doubled the recipe but because I so often forget egg whites sitting in my refrigerator I decided to use three whole eggs rather than six egg yolks. I also substituted powdered sugar for caster sugar. Because the white of the egg is bigger than the yolk I found it necessary to add quite a bit of coconut to make it possible to form balls from the dough. Lots of changes, I know, but the result was terrific. When I make them again, and assuming I double the recipe, I will use only two whole eggs instead of three which would make them not quite as runny and difficult to manipulate. Even though the cookies were obviously sweeter than they would have been with unsweetened coconut they still were not overly sweet.

I made the batter ahead of time,as I like to let it rest in the fridge for as long as possible before using,as I find it produces much better results (up to 24 hours ahead if poss!).I used my usual 4 hole yorkshire pudding tray,and after heating the tray and oil in the oven I placed it over a high gas flame to get it to smoke a little,before tossing the chipolatas into their holes and turning them to quickly brown the outsides,then adding the chilled batter mixture,and putting into the oven.
They rose beautifully (much to DH's relief!),and the children thought it was fun to have their own individual Toads in their Holes.The gravy was the real star of the show though.The sugar makes all the difference,and it was totally delicious..

192325,1844836,0,0,"I have tried a lot of stuffed jalapeno recipes and loved most all of them.  This one is a good one with a pretty authentic Mexican flavor.  I noticed that one reviewer was not happy with the ""spiciness"" of the jalapenos.  I can immediately think of two reasons that could happen.  First it is the chilies themselves, jalapenos used to have a reputation for heat but now most of them seem to be too mild to be of much use.  I believe this is because so many of them are now force fed with fertilizers and water to make them grow faster and thus generate more profits.  It is a known fact that jalapenos grown under stress from a lack of water and a lot of hot sun will be hot.  In the store you can identify the hottest ones by the ""stretch marks"" running vertically in the skin.  The second possible reason for the result not being spicy or hot is the failure to use the Rotel brand of tomatoes used by Paula.  These tomatoes are canned with hot jalapenos included in the mix.  Regular canned tomatoes will be tame by comparison.",2011-03-04

The base sauce/aromatics is just that good, you could pair it with anything.",2013-05-24

33058,55729,3,0,"These are in 500 Low-Carb Recipes by Dana Carpender, so I had made them before. The note in my book says ""These are really good."" I am sure at that time that I baked them in a half-sheet, because my other note says ""line with aluminum foil"" and I remember them being clumpy  due to my inability to sprinkle accurately. This time I used a huge bowl to mix the spices and tossed the wings in the bowl, which resulted in much better coverage. I also baked them on a rack over the half-sheet. My kids thought that there was ""more heat than flavor,"" and I agreed. They used ranch, I ate them plain. An interesting thing, though, was that at room temperature the flavors were much more balanced. Since these are easy and use ingredients I always have (except for running out of thyme - gotta put that on my list) I will probably make them again in a pinch, as a lunch/snack for me, or as part of a much larger spread. I also served Recipe #150380, which admittedly was a rather strange choice.",2009-06-23

324501,280271,5,1,10/1/2008 This didn't work for me. The dough was to runny. Maybe it needs more flour or less liquid. The hardest part of the recipe was finding the self-rising flour in the store. When  cooked they became flat like a pancake. We did love the flavor. Think I may give it another shot using less liquid. I made sure to not over mix.  10/02/2008 I made these again tonight but used less liquid. I used 2/3 cup of milk and 2/3 cup of mayonnaise and they came out perfect. Nice and fluffy and TALL just like biscuits are suppose to be. These have a wonderful flavor. Thanks for posting. Made for PAC Fall 2008.,2008-10-06

I used 1/2 c mayo and 2/3 c milk, added slowly as I stirred the mayo into the flour (not easy to find self rising flour here in Canada).  I then turned out onto a floured countertop and patted the dough down to about 1/4 in, folded it over and cut 2 1/2 in biscuits.  They rose nicely, didn't brown all that much, but were very good.  We noticed the salt, but our diets have been very reduced in salt, so any amount seems alot.  Enjoyed the biscuits with a big salad.  Shall make again and again and again.  BTW, I saved the last two biscuits for dessert with homemade strawberry jam, the sweet and salty tastes were wonderful!!",2012-03-31

324501,2577508,5,1,"Howdy! Made two batches. Delicious. Leave it to the cackalackies to come up with a winner!<br/><br/>First, gotta agree with previous posters, as printed the liquids are too much. For me, the winning ratio for 2 cups of flour was closer to 1/2 cup mayo, 2/3 cup milk as mentioned by other posters. Maybe for the printed liquids it's 2 heaping cups of flour, not sure. <br/><br/>Second note, self-rising flour is just flour with baking powder and salt added. So : 2 level cups flour, 1 level tbsp baking powder, pinch of salt will get you there (save you some cash and difficulty trying to find it also). <br/><br/>Final note, 1 tsp honey into the batter really does wonders.",2012-12-21

Since the veggies were already simmering, I went with 1 can cannelini, 1 dark kidney and 1 pink kidney.  The chili was really nice and had a nice natural sweetness coming from the peppers.  The addition of the fresh cilantro also infused the pot with this great aroma and taste.  In preparing this again, and I will, I'd make 2 small changes and write these for others.  First, keep the diced peppers some what large so that the don't melt into the sauce. I would also consider reducing the amount of zucchini as it seemed to overwhelm the peppers.  ",2005-07-28

8920,65056,4,1,"I used breasts for this, which worked well, though I do think that a combination of breasts and thighs might be nice.  I found the directions to be a little confusing (e.g.  ""paste of minced onion and garlic"" and cook the chiken until it is ""a la dente""), but it worked out okay in the end.  I made a coarse puree of the garlic, onion and yogurt in my food processor, added a little salt and marinated my chicken in that.  I didn't find that I needed the extra 1/2 cup water called for in step 11, the onion/garlic puree was watery enough.  I would really appreciate it if all the ingredients called for in the recipe (1/2 cup water to cook the chicken, fresh tomatoes, cilantro or parsley to garnish) were specified in the ingredient list.  The flavor to this was really nice, I was surprised at how much flavor the cardamom pods, cinnamon stick and cloves leant.  I did add about 1/4 tsp turmeric for a little color, but I think this would be lovely without it too, as it is very white (especially with chicken breasts) and would be nicely black and white with the pepper in it.  The pepper was really nice- I love how spicy it can make this without adding any chile peppers.  I think fresh ground is absolutely necessary.  I did use ghee instead of oil, but otherwise stuck to the recipe pretty much.  This is Indian-ish, but not quite full-fledged Indian flavor... I guess it is, like you said, ""fusion"".  A nice dish, though and something I would certainly recommend.",2005-05-06

I used rice wine vinegar and greatly reduced the cayenne so our preschooler could eat it. I topped it with baby carrots quartered lengthwise, quartered sliced water chestnuts, green onion and chopped cilantro. It had a delicious flavor--not too sweet. The only improvement I can think of is possibly the addition of a little fresh grated gingerroot?

I halved the recipe and it made enough for 4-6 generous servings.  I did find that the bacon burned a little, even though I cooked it on the lowest heat for an hour and stirred frequently.  This didn't effect the flavour though.  I think next time, I might add a little more water during the cooking process.  After simmering for an hour, there was no excess liquid, so I just stirred in the maple syrup and reheated without bothering with the extra 30 minutes of cooking uncovered.  The taste was extraordinary - sweet with a rich flavour of the port.  I think next time I will probably not halve the garam masala, but that's the only small change I'd make to this fabulous recipe.

The Farm Market is open by our house, so I couldn't resist buying a bag of beautiful baby greens as a substitute for the spinach and romaine.  I also succumbed to the local lavendar goat cheese which I think was much better than the feta.

I served mine w/my Recipe #355506. This recipe is very forgiving, but the camera tells the tale. About the only error you can make is to shape the meatballs too lrg, tear the pita bread as you assemble the sandwiches & then have to plate the veggies on the side.

My version did not have broccoli, olives, or tomatoes, but I know this dish would be equally (if not even more so) yummy with them included.  I used tri-colour fusilli (spinach, tomato, and regular) and I cut the cheese into small cubes instead of shredding it (quicker and less clean-up for me that way).

196210,2000207626,0,0,"This is a warning about the cooking time for the yam. It should be TEN minutes, as is written in the recipe.

The problem is that the number 10 in the recipe can look like 20 when printed or viewed on the screen because the number 1 (one) has a &quot;serif&quot; and looks similar to the number 2 (two).

My mother misread the 10 (ten) minute cooking time as 20 (twenty) minutes. At 15 minutes, they yam exploded into flames in the microwave, destroying the microwave oven. If she were not in the kitchen when this happened, her house could have burned down.

However, I have a bit of experience working with yeast. About the only thing I can say for sure is this recipe does produce a flat bread that tastes good. Two risings and garlic in the dough made for a nicely flavored bread. I tried to keep the dough a bit slack, or moist, while kneading. I still ended up with a somewhat heavy bread. I suspect it was because I accidentally added the garlic in the beginning and some yeast might have been killed off. I baked the dough on my pizza stone in a 550 degree oven. The first 3 came out like flat bread. The rest puffed up like pita bread. I&#039;m not sure if naan usually does that. I will try this recipe again. Thanks for sharing it. :)",2014-06-25

I didn&#039;t have milk, so I skipped that, and since this was being served with a highly seasoned lamb curry, I left out the garlic, too. Actually, I didn&#039;t butter them after cooking, either.
Okay, so, I used only 4 cups of flour, left out the milk, butter, and garlic, and added 1/4 tsp baking soda, to ensure bubbles in the surface ~ it worked, by the way.
The second rise was an hour for me; it rolled beautifully, and puffed &amp; browned exactly as it should. I used a very hot grill, and a light coating of EVOO.
This dough is quite stiff, I found, so be prepared to do some work for this. Absolutely worth it, though.

The only complant I have would be that part of the stuffing was hard and didnt cook, so we had to pick around it. The recipe called for 1 box but it said 12oz, so I used two boxes. The boxs are 6oz each so I was wondering if it was a typo. Next time I make it Im going to prepare the stuffing seperately and put it ontop of the chicken for the last 5 min in the oven. The chicken was so moist!",2008-11-09

12866,117781,4,1,"This was quite tasty.  I don't really know if it is truly low fat considering the cake mix, chocolate chips, and pudding mix all have a bit of fat in them. (I have never seen a ""fat free"" cake mix in my grocery store) Keeping that in mind I also lowered the sugar content by using sugar free, fat free instant pudding mix, no sugar added applesauce and I cut the chocolate chips down to 6 ounces. I only had yellow cake mix on hand, so although the color looked a little strange, the cake was pretty yummy. The texture is somewhere in the middle between light and dense, but is moist and flavorful nonetheless. The batter was quite thick and I ended up needing to add about 1/3 of a cup more water to yield a better consistency. An hour seemed like a long amount of baking time so I set my timer for 45 minutes, and when I checked on it at that time it was perfectly done.  I'm glad I checked it early when I began to smell the delicious aroma emanating from my oven, because if it had baked any longer it would have been much drier and harder in texture.  Overall, this was a super easy, quick and tasty and I appreciate you sharing the recipe! We enjoyed it most slightly warm and with a cup of coffee.",2007-01-04

293683,199792,4,1,This was a very good sandwich although I did make a few changes. My guys are not big on open-faced so I gave the sandwich a top. I put cheese on top and bottom slices of bread. I left off the sprouts and salad dressing as a personal pref. I loved the avocado in this sandwich. It was great with the bacon. The green onion is also a great addition. I really couldn't taste the mushrooms. Be careful not to toast the bread too much as they are best when not overly crispy. We all agreed that we would like to have them again.

As I was reading te recipe, I realized that it never had a place to add the ground beef, so I added it after step 5.

If I could give this any more stars I would.  We LOVED this dish!!  I have two very picky eaters who I did NOT think would eat peppers but they smelled this cooking and proceeded to *devour* them.  This is so good and good for you, the only thing remotely not healthy here is the cheese and you could easily omit or use reduced fat if you like.  These are excellent warmed up for lunch during the week, too.  When I heat these at work everyone wants to know what it is that smells so amazing.

I also added scrambled 2 eggs in with the rice and cooked the rice in homemade chicken stock.  My dad LOVES stuffed peppers, so when the parents come to visit, this will be on the menu.  I may try these with shredded chicken or turkey next time.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!!!!!",2009-03-14
11523,1012889,5,1,"Excellent Recipe!!!  My husband and I LOVED THESE Peppers!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and only used 2 peppers, so the cooking times changed from the original recipe.  
One of the ways I made this lighter is that I steamed the 4 pepper halves 30-40min, used olive oil to saute the onions an garlic (5 mins), and then used ground turkey BREAST instead of regular,  I didn't want to overcook my peppers in the oven so I went ahead and browned my turkey breast in the same pan with the onions/garlic.  Once the turkey was browned, I added the remaining stuffing ingredients and mixed together as directed by the recipe. I stuffed my steamed peppers with the mixture and placed them in the oven until the breadcrumbs started to brown and appear somewhat crispy.  I then took the peppers out, spooned a few dabs of my favorite tomato sauce and topped with shredded mozzarella cheese.  Baked in the oven another 5 minutes to melt/brown the cheese.  
VIOLA!!!  It was perfect and VERY Tasty!!  Thank you Dibs!",2009-05-29

Also, my red bell peppers weren't very bell-like, so I ended up having flat bell peppers and topping them with the meat mixture then the bread crumb mixture.

I drizzled olive oil on the stuffed peppers before baking to add moisture. I baked for 30 minutes and this resulted in a slightly undercooked medium-sized pepper. I'd bake for 40 next time, or wrap in foil. I'd also double the amount of diced peppers. Thank you for this recipe! It's a keeper.",2011-08-26

According to the recipe builder on the WW site, if you only get 24 cookies, it is 2 points plus for 1 cookie but 5 points plus for 2. I substituted a small box of instant vanilla pudding for the custard powder. I also didn&#039;t have self-rising flour so I used the appropriate equivalents of baking powder, salt and regular flour. At first, they were a little salty. As they sat, that seemed to mellow out a bit. Not sure if it because I use sea salt or if Australian self-rising flour has a different ratio of salt. Next time, I&#039;ll use less. I used just a tad more than 8 Tbls. of Land-O-Lake&#039;s light butter to get the 120 grams. (Maybe the Australian light butter isn&#039;t salted?)

This recipe is very close. Getting the correct flavor of BBQ sauce will be the key. As for their own seasoning you could probably use Tony Chachere.",2012-03-21

Also, not sure if my family is wimpy or if it is just because I use a good quality chipotle powder from Penzy's, but 1/2 teaspoon was perfect. More would have been over-powering. The BEST with sweet potato fries!!!!",2017-09-14

I actually took so many liberties with the recipe that I almost can't say that I followed it, but what I did whip up was very tasty and satisfying. I couldn't find any dried pasillas at the grocery store, so I bypassed the chili sauce. Also, instead of puree-ing the beans (partly because I don't have a food processor), I used some prepared roasted red pepper hummus. I added a little Tabasco sauce in the cheese mixture to make up for the lost heat of the chili sauce. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly! ;-) Hopefully next time I will be able to find all of the ingredients and I will have the time (and a food processor) to make the bean mixture.

Using the previous reviewers tip on making the burgers early and letting them sit to marry with the seasonings is exactly what we did. I also caramelized the onions earlier, letting the slowly caramelize and used a bit less sugar, and the taste came out perfectly. The beer in the beef, and the beer added to the onions was just wonderful and really jazzed up the both. I used Dijon mustard as suggested and cheddar cheese as the topping and this was just so juicy and tasty, I could of been a very bad girl and eaten *2* burgers.

193861,86512,5,1,This is a greaat meal!! They went together so well.  The hamburger was moist. I think I overmixed it. I cut the recipe in half. I formed one patty and then read the recipe again to see how I should cook and saw that I had forgotten to put the Dijon in. I put the patty in the bowl and mixed the mustard in. I didn't want to put it in the fridge and let it get cold again. The patty fell apart when I tried to turn it over. That's okay. It still cooked up nice.  The onions were so good. I only used about 2/3 of a large  onion but I should have used all of it.  This is a keeper of a recipe. I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing your recipe Leslie.

I evenly spread out the batter instead of filling them to the top and it made 12 muffins when I filled each muffin tin about 60-75% full. They were done in about 14 minutes. If you fill them up to the top,  you&#039;ll get less muffins, but they would probably take the full 20 minute baking time. I recommend putting the sugar for the topping in a ziploc bag and adding a drop of vanilla to make vanilla-flavored sugar and to give it an even better aroma. Large-crystal sugar works best for the topping [but use regular for the batter].",2015-05-14

I took leftovers for lunch the next day, and while the flavor was still good, the chips had gone soft (I should have known they would, but it was worth a try!)

I think when I make these again, I'm going to stick with the mixed bag of chips, because they were really good that way. I found the oats to be a little bit too prominent a flavor/texture when they were fresh out of the oven, but I think the flavor improved after the cookies were cooled. Not that they tasted bad when they were first baked, they just seemed a bit granola bar-ish to me at first ( I was expecing something a little bit more gooey, I think). All in all, very good cookies!

Then I added a bit of buttermilk and drizzles of extra virgin olive oil and it was really good.  We used this aioli as dipping sauce for our steamed artichokes.

I liked the addition of the fresh coriander but would not use it next time if serving with the same thing. Also I did crush my garlic so I used less and then it sat overnight in the fridge and it's taste became stronger. I wouldn't leave for so long next time out of preference. I used Helmans Olive oil mayonnaise to be soy free and did not add any additional salt because it didn't need it. I like to add a bit of Balkan yogurt to make it lighter as well.

Other ingredients per recipe.&lt;br/&gt;Drain and wring out the sauerkraut, that soggy thing again. Pizza was excellent, next time will cook a little longer as the well cooked bits were the best.

I used Thomas' blueberry bagels, fresh blueberries, added a touch more cinnamon, and replaced the sugar with Splenda.  OH. MY. GOSH. This was soooo good!  Not too heavy.

I made a half recipe with some old bagels that had been in the fridge for quite some time! I used only skim milk (no cream) and 2 large eggs. By accident, I used the full 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Might cut down on the orange zest a little next time.  Since I overcooked it a bit, I served with Kittencal's Vanilla Sauce.",2009-08-02

I also substituted plain fat-free greek yogurt for the heavy cream, with excellent results. Thanks, Caroline, for a lovely recipe! I will be making this again.",2011-03-10
308177,2000873121,0,0,"The Blueberry bagel bread pudding recipe was gross. Somehow it was bready tasting.   The bagels were to heavy and absorbed all liquid before I put it in the oven.  If you choose to make this item.  I would suggest adding more liquid...1 more egg and 1/2 cup milk.  (unless you only use 4 bagels there might be enough liquid to set it)

I myself am sticking to my Grandmas old fashion bread pudding.   And add fruit to the top in your bowl afterwards. Theres no other like it.",2016-02-13

145662,624638,4,1,I love this dish. I'm not crazy about sun dried tomatoes though so I just put in two diced roma tomatoes. I also added a bit more green onion and stirred the parmesan into the sauce at the end to make sort of an alfredo sauce. I used about a 1/4 cup. It was really good! I also used penne pasta instead of linguine.,2007-11-03

24299,39949,5,1,"This is my new favorite recipe.  Wow.  Made this last night for our best friends, and all of us were totally blown away by the flavors, the moistness of the meat, the thickness of the sauce, and the overall savory, sensational taste of this dish.  I made this exactly as directed, EXCEPT I forgot to drain the fat before adding the veggies, but I was lucky and had a lean roast.  This is a great company dinner, and I guess it would make for some divine leftovers...if there ARE any, that is!  My roast was almost 3 pounds, and I braised it about 1 hour, 25 minutes, and it was just perfect.  This one is a definite ""go to"" recipe for us now, Bergy.  DH asked me today if we could have it again over the weekend (LOL).  As you can see, it was a real hit with us.  Delicious, and definitely 5-star!",2003-10-31
24299,86318,5,1,"This is very much comfort food! It kind of took me and my husband by surprise, because we'd been eating a lot of spicy dishes. It's not quite bland, but it's definitely not spicy. Since we can't stop eating it, I guess I've got to give it 5 stars! Other than using about 1 pound and a half pork, and adding the extra ounce of beer that was in the can, I followed the recipe strictly. If I hadn't been trying to behave, I think I would have added some garlic, some tomato, I don't know what. But this is very satisfying just like it is. Thank you for the recipe.",2004-10-31
24299,293797,5,1,"Extra-ordinary.  Easy to make and soooo good! I used Guinness Draft (15 oz can) I used the entire can because my roast was about 2-1/4 lbs.and therefore increased the juniper berries by 2 and cloves by 1 was also extra generous with veggies.

1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil(simmered with, parsley, minced fresh garlic, oregano, and salt)
after simmering the oil strain the mixture so you just have the oil left
next add 1/3 cup of you favourite hot sauce(I use franks Red Hot).....mix all these together with the original recipie(minus the parsley and garlic)

I left marinated mushrooms out of both. For mine I used the hard-boiled egg pushed thru a sieve & found I liked the addition. For DH I dbld the mustard (Dijon for his) & left out the pickles. We were both happy, but he still prefers his reg stuff called Gravlax Sosa. The beauty of a recipe like this is that pers pref & the palate can dictate any chgs. Thx for posting this. I love to try Czech & Polish recipes.",2007-01-03

245636,88099,5,1,Excellent pound cake.  I didn't put any kind of glaze on it because it was good all by itself.  I did note that there are no directions for when to add the 5 eggs so I added them one at a time after I had creamed the sugar and butter.  I used regular butter since I don't keep margarine.  Thanks for a great recipe.,2008-04-05

The dish was a bit more soupy than I expected, but I had no problem with it since it's meant to be eaten with chips anyway, and I wouldn't have wanted a dish too stiff to scoop.  I thought this was good, but I think a bit mire salt would help, and perhaps a healthy dose of cumin just for some added flavor.  I'll make this again, but may try to tweak it and see what I can come up with, but over all, it was good, especially with some homemade cornbread muffins.",2010-09-30

We lined a glass bowl with large romaine leaves and served the salad at basically room temperature. We had about a cup of leftovers, which were wonderful cold, too. My only complaint about the recipe is that I didn't register that the olive oil was divided, but it didn't matter. The optional red pepper flakes were very much a part of the great blend of flavors, and I added a sprinkling of hot sweet paprika powder to the sweet potatoes, too. The recipe is sinfully easy; the hardest part was peeling the sweet potatoes!",2008-06-09

306507,171303,5,1,Loved this recipe.  I much prefer sweet potatoes savory rather than sweet and  this recipe foots that bill.  It is both hearty and refreshing.  I did use cayenne instead of the hot pepper flakes so that it would evenly coat the potatoes.  Also I found that my potatoes were fork tender at 15 minutes and was glad I checked because I did not want them mushy.  I chilled the salad for ac couple hours to let the flavors marry and the leftovers were even better the next day.  Thank you Reddyrat for sharing the recipe.,2009-06-25

Prob would have been 5 stars except I drank a glass of that wine while I made it...got a bit slap happy with the lemon so it was a bit strong.  Also, here in Fiji many ingredients are not readily available...I couldn't find rosemary OR oregano so used Mixed Herbs instead.  Prob would have been better with the right stuff, but it still did the job. Used lemon granules instead of juice? great stuff, just don't drink at the same time : ))  This is a great recipe and we loved it.  Skipped the parsley, (parsley in Fiji? maybe somewhere) Used fillets, used marg instead of unsalted butter and chicken stock powder in water...and it was really nice.  Served with honeyed carrots.   Actually it's the best thing I've eaten in the three months we've lived here!  So what the heck, I'll give it 5 stars anyway... : )))  And yes.  We'll have this again.",2007-10-22

172789,827921,5,1,"Yay! A chicken recipe that isn't 'blah'! I had a bunch of thawed out dark chicken parts (bone in/skin-on) in the fridge and I wondered what I'd do with them this afternoon... luckily I found this recipe and had everything on hand. The only changes I made were that I chose to cook this on the stove top rather than finish in the oven (sort of braising the chicken in the sauce). I also added 2 dried bay leaves after replacing the chicken into the pan, and I squeezed only one lemon wedge into the dish and threw in the lemon wedge with the dish to cook (of course, remove it after cooking), this way I didn't have to be excessive with the lemon juice but I got a subtle, infused lemon taste throughout the dish. I normally discard the skin when it's time to eat, but I couldn't resist how tasty it looked (check out my pic to see :)... I served this with lightly, buttered egg noodles. Me and my 2 yo daughter loved it... can't wait till the hubby gets home :) Thanks for the simple and yummy recipe!",2009-09-10

I tried it the first time using chickpea flour since I usually use chickpea flour for breading/dredging things and while it tasted wonderful my gravy was clumpy and disgusting looking.,2009-12-10

Even tho the chicken was cooked, I cut into pieces and stuck it in the pan with 2 T. olive oil for about 5 minutes. Proceeded to make the sauce, then added the chicken back in, only to warm it up, about 10 minutes.

I did use a mixture of skim milk and some half & half that I wanted to use up, and I skipped the sauce (I never eat sauce on my bread pudding).

I was really happy with how well the dill flavor went with this.  I used homemade vegetable broth , and found that I had to use the larger amount called for, and we like our soups thick!

95409,815244,5,1,"Wow! Perfect synchronicity lead me to this recipe as I was actually looking for BULGUR soup recipes and inadvertently put in BARLEY. I used a cup of bulgur wheat instead of the barley, omitted the parsnips as we had none.  I also used ham and ham stock instead of chicken, did not omit the dill, even when I wasn't sure how it would pair with the ham.  I did reduce the amount, however, to about a tablespoon. Dolloped on plain Greek yogurt to serve.
The end result? WOW, what a soup!! Thick, rich, hearty and sooo flavorful and good! Can't wait to try it tomorrow as I am sure after it mellows it will be even better. Next time I will try it with lentils.
Some people say ""lucky accidents"" but I don't believe in those ;) Excellent, thanks so much for posting, Winkki!!!",2009-11-17
95409,157806,5,1,"It's been a really long time since I bothered to write a review for anything here, but I just had to let everyone know how wonderful this soup is! It really stands out from the crowd, that's for sure. We especially loved the fresh dill. Very hearty and rustic. It has a taste of the ""old country"" to me, like an Eastern European dish. Thank you for this major keeper!",2010-02-21
95409,545970,4,1,An interesting soup.  I didn't like it as well with the dill as I did without.  Very thick the first day and even thicker the second day.  My kids ate it and enjoyed it.  I used only one small can of chicken.  I froze about 3 qts of this as it made a LOT.,2010-12-16
95409,1691493,5,1,This was SO good. I had never tried sweet potatoes before this recipe (love them now). I would not use the dill again even though I like dill a lot. Thanks for something new :),2011-01-02
95409,1052827,0,0,"I followed the recipe as far as ingredients go but changed the technique as pr chef friend's instructions.  I sauteed the onion, carrots, and celery for 20 min then added the grated parsnip and sauteed all that for another 10 min.  Then I added finely chopped sweet potatoes and sauteed that another 10 min.  This all helps build flavors.  Then I added broth and cooked it just until sweet potatoes were cooked and not falling apart.  I cooked the barley separately so I had more control over the thickness of the final product.  I added the barley along with the cooking water it was in to add the thickness you get when using barley in a soup.  I would say I used more broth than the recipe called for.  Like other reviewers I found it a little bland.  I added some parsley at the end and that helped visually as well as the taste.  It is a hearty, healthy soup and it makes a TON of soup.  Lucky I had lots of people to share it with.  I will update this review with their comments later.",2011-01-02
95409,496999,5,1,"I was a bit unsure of whether I'd like this soup as I'm not a huge dill fan, but DH is, so I tried it anyways. I loved it, my husband loved it, and my two non soup loving kids asked for it for breakfast the next day! It is rich and really nicely flavored - dh thought I'd put butter in it.(though I skipped celery and parsnips as I had none, and used dried dill) A very satisfying soup. We had it with whole wheat buns #168802.<br/>Also, as a general rule, I make soups the day before we eat them because they are so much better the second day, but this is one we're happy to eat on the day I make it. Making it today for a snow day.",2012-03-03
95409,1179225,5,1,"We REALLY liked this! I did make some changes, but nothing major. I halved the recipe. Also, I didn't have a parsnip, so that may have been kind of a big deal, I'm sure it would be great in this recipe. Anyway, no parsnip, used skinless chicken thighs, used a teaspoon of dried dill and poultry seasoning, used 3 cloves of garlic, only used one sweet potato, and added about 1 teaspoon of cider vinegar and a 1/4 cup of fresh parsley at the end. So, so good. To me, this is more like a stew. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I know I made some changes, but I'm looking forward to making it again as written.

I did add onions sliced to step 13 and a bit of herbs de provence on each chicken breast, and incorporated them into the puff pastry.  Could also see a little diced tomatoes drained and/or artichoke hearts...I didn't have boursin so subbed rondele herbs and garlic cheese...mmmm...this would make a wonderful company meal!

I only had one can of chicken broth but doubled all the rest of the ingredients so I had to add water to the pan inorder to soften the carrots enough as I didn't have a mandolin to make nice even slices.  Served with broccoli and brown rice and we had enough for our meal and lunchboxes and not a drop more.  I will be making this for the clients again.

17591,348174,5,1,I have made this soup many times now since coming across it here at Recipezaar.  I make a big batch and freeze it in containers to microwave for lunch at work.  It has become one of my favorite lunches!  It's satisfying and delicious!  Thank you for a great recipe!,2008-07-06
17591,743849,5,1,"Delicious!  Made this tonight for my in-laws and everyone finished their bowls with compliments.  I used a whole package of lean hamburger and 1 onion - I didn't measure out the onion.  Also, I substituted fresh green beans for canned and fresh parsley for dried.  VERY easy, VERY good.  I love that I usually have these ingredients on hand in the pantry.  I will make this soup again.  Great recipe!",2008-08-25
17591,15913,5,1,"I had a feeling this recipe would be a keeper, and I was right. I went ahead and made a double batch of it the first time so that I could freeze individual portions. I did make a couple of substitutions. First of all, I didn't have any cream of tomato soup in the pantry, so I used regular condensed tomato soup and substituted evaporated skim milk for some of the water and tomato sauce (to keep the proportions intact). I used instant brown rice. Instead of canned beans, I used a 16-ounce package of frozen cut green beans (remember, this was for a double recipe). Even with these changes, the soup turned out beautifully -- thick, rich and flavorful. I definitely will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing!",2008-11-02
17591,663997,3,0,This was ok.  It needed more flavor.  I added some garlic and some steak seasoning.  I used frozen beans.  It was a fast prep.,2008-11-08
17591,183634,5,1,"This dish is the best, especially on cold winter evenings! I know it says that regular condensed soup can be used instead of the condensed cream soup, however, I actually liked the cream of tomato back when I could actually find it. So, I usually add just a little heavy cream when I add the soup and I think it really makes this dish wonderful. I have doubled this recipe for my family, and even tripled it when guests were coming over and everyone loves it. The only problem is that I never seem to have any leftovers ;-(  I have actually made this about a dozen times, can't believe I forgot to rate it!",2009-01-15
17591,601585,5,1,"I made this months ago and forgot to rate, sorry. I like this recipe cause I had all the ingredients on hand. I added a pinch of cayanne to add some kick.

17591,369715,4,1,This was good and easy to make but I thought it needed more seasonings. I doubled the recipe but followed it exactly other then I didn't spray my pan with cooking spray before adding the meat. We ate it for dinner and I also took it for lunch the next day. The next day it was more like a thick stew that I ate with a fork.,2009-07-07

17591,840306,4,1,"Considering how simple this was to prepare, this was pretty good. I, too, used a can of low sodium tomato soup and 1 cup of milk. I may try using cream of tomato soup next time and 1.5 c beef broth to see if that improves the flavor. Oh, and I left out the rice and served this with cornbread. May, or may not, make this again.",2010-05-04
17591,60190,4,1,"Made this the other day for my niece and nephew who are 6 and 3. I had my doubts about whether they would eat it. They took one look at it and said no thanks, but after trying it they both gobbled it up and said it was good. It wasnt soupy at all but that may have been my fault, but it was still good! I used pasta instead of rice (preference), and tomato soup with some milk instead of cream of tomato. Also used French cut green beans and think I will from now on... Added a little garlic powder and worcestershire sauce and it made a great meal! Thanks! UPDATE: I have made this a few times now and Ive found that its easier to cook the noodles (or rice) separate and just add in as much as you need to the individual servings. That way if there's any leftover it will still taste fresh the next day! P.S.--The kids still love it!! :)",2010-06-11

89786,456138,5,1,"I sort of backed into this recipe because I was looking for a curried cabbage-y soup-y idea to transform leftover Spanish rice into a new meal. Was thrilled to find this recipe because I had some soy breakfast sausage patties in the freezer, and frankly, I don't like them very much, so I thought aha! This will disguise them and use them up! My rice already had onions, oil, butter, tomato and rice in it, so I added everything else listed in the recipe. The only changes made were to omit the white sugar and to use golden raisins instead of dark ones, and I cooked it for only 20 minutes until the cabbage was tender. It was very tasty and made a satisfying dinner, and it used up all my leftover rice and two of those darn sausages! Thanks for the good idea.",2011-04-26
254384,498271,5,1,"This is a great ""bread"" with so many possible variations!  The potatoes make it so dense and filling that it's more of a side dish than simply a bread.  I served it with beef that had a spicy gravy and it was a perfect accompaniment.  I think it would also be great with a layer of cheddar between the potato part and the biscuit patty and served for breakfast with scrambled eggs.  All in all a great recipe that I will use again!",2008-02-26
108678,56919,5,1,Yummy comfort dish.  The sauerkraut mellows after cooking and the potato helps with the texture and the rest of the ingredients give nice flavor.  Great on a big fat hot dog. :),2005-01-25

I didn't use rum or brandy b/c I didn't have it in the house, but I did use rum flavoring and a splash of Kahlua.  I think the next time I make these I might slice the babas and place them in a dish of the simple syrup to let them soak.  It was a little time consuming to brush the syrup on each sides over and over again.  They tasted great and refrigerated well.  I tried to soften up the mascarpone cheese by whipping it a little with a wisk before I put it in a pastry bag to put in the middle of the babas.  I used more than 1 1/2tsp of the cheese too.  I also dusted them with sweetened cocoa powder at the end.  Very Good and I will surely make again!!",2004-08-05

I then added the seasoning, closed the lid and began to Smoke the Garlic.  After 45 minutes as the Recipe states I turned the Smoker off but left it on the hotplate like the Recipe states for another 15 minutes.  Once the Garlic was cool enough to handle I then thought of how I was going to skin the Garlic clove, firstly I used a butter knife to squeeze the garlic from each clove, but this method was going to take forever, so then I started to pass each clove through a Garlic Press, but this method was just too messy.  So then I just Squeezed the whole bulb from the bottom upwards and the Cloves just fell out.  If you find an easier way of skinning a Smoked Garlic Clove or Bulb then please let me know.",2015-03-16

336497,352845,5,1,WOW!  This was yummy.  The flavor of the chicken broth was so intense.   I could have put it in a cup and drank it straight.  The only thing I did differently was to cook it on top of the stove.  After I made the sauce (and I made extra) I just put the chicken into the sauce and put the garlic and lemons on top.  I simmered it for about 30 minutes and served it over rice.  We almost licked the pan!  Great recipe!,2009-04-23

Surprisingly, the garlic taste was very mild even though I used the full amount.  I may try this recipe again but would eliminate the lemon entirely and perhaps saute the garlic to release more of it's flavor.  The chicken was very moist and I also added some halved red baby potatoes to make a one dish dinner.  Thanks for posting.",2009-07-08

I left the skin on the thighs, which was a mistake as there was way too much fat on top when I took it out of the oven, which led to the sauce being a bit fatty.

I'm not sure of the ""10 min prep"" time -- but any effort was worth it.  I truly love to have the meat falling off the bones, but these were very large thighs -- done, but not to that extent.

Since I made it, I feel that I can give a fair review. I do feel that the spices were a bit off- I added extra cumin and extra chili powder. I REALLY enjoyed the addition of the lemon rind- although I didn't know from the directions when to add it, so I just added in the 'whole spice' section. I'd use full fat coco milk in this for sure. It just pushes the entire flavor to something very special. Thanks!",2009-03-17
209859,451700,5,1,"Wish I could give it 10 stars! This is a FABULOUS recipe. I was looking for a mild curry to make for our boarding house dinner since the boys are not into spicy food. But they did request for a curry! This was perfect. I used 4 kilos of chicken and adjusted the rest of the quantities around it. I had to make a few minor changes though: I used tins of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh, I added in lemon juice instead of vinegar and since I couldn't get hold of curry leaves, I added in chopped coriander in the end (I know it's not the same as using curry leaves). I am not exaggerating when I say the entire pot was empty within 30 mins. I didn't get to eat any but I did taste it for seasoning before sending it upstairs to the dining hall and I was so looking forward to having it!!! I am happy to say I got thumbs up from ALL the boys. They said it had a slight tingle but the amount of spiciness was spot on.

I made a few modifications because I just can&#039;t cook a recipe exactly as it is written.  I used 1.5 pounds of thighs and leg meat, though I didn&#039;t change the rest of the proportions.  I added extra onion, tomatos (from my garden!, a green pepper, and Thai chilis(from my garden!).  I used dried ginger instead of fresh.  I used &quot;chile powder&quot; (actual ground chiles, not the Texas stuff), because I think that is what was meant.  I used 1 T of cumin seeds instead of ground cumin, frying them with the curry leave.  I used 1 teaspoon of lemon juice instead of the rind and lemongrass, and I used ground cinnamon instead of a stick.  Also, I used extra coconut milk so it would be more saucy. I thickened my sauce with cornstarch. And it is amazing.  Mine came out extra spicy because of the 4 Thai chiles. I froze this in meal size batches with a little brown rice to take to work with my since my husband doesn&#039;t like spicy food (blasphemy!).

I had to melt it so I mixed everything in the bowl and gently incorporated the ghee in the batter kinda folding in. It&#039;s only me so I use one of those green pancake pans. They came out great. Btw I don&#039;t use much sugar and was out of Palm sugar too but had some powder sugar from the holiday baking. Seems like it worked fine.  The first one cooked too fast so I turned the pan down more than I usually do. The outside was just the way I like it and  it was fluffy inside.

I also used Splenda in place of the sugar and for my family's taste I added 3 tsp. I used all dried seasoning as it was not stated if I was to use both fresh and dried. The best thing about this recipe was how thick the sauce got it's the way I love my sauces. Overall this was ok tasting I did end up adding 1/4 tsp each garlic and onion powder.

88936,223169,5,1,"Marvellous. I knew from the first reading that this would be a great recipe, but it turned out as one of those rare gems you have the luck to find sometimes. The grilled fish has still a firm texture and delicate flavors. The marinade adds its own different flavors. Terragon, olive and the capers gave the marinade a special touch.  The taste of fish and marinade after chilling are well balanced. Both can stand on their own, but together they are wonderful. The recipe is very easy (I would say foolproof) and can be prepared in advance even for a large number of guests. Use the fish you like most or (for guests) use different fish fillets. Serve it with some roasted bread and you will have an extraordinary dish and your guest will ask you for this recipe again and again. This is a winner and a keeper. Try it, love it.

I recommend wearing latex gloves when you mix the ingredients (which I allowed to chill 24 hours before I formed and coated the cheese ball) and when you roll the ball in chopped nuts. I chopped 1 cup of walnut halves in my food processor and had 3/16 cup left after I coated this 4-inch diameter cheese ball; a pasta dish was the perfect size for the ball coating step. The cream cheese predominated, and I admit a personal bias for a higher proportion of cheddar cheese. I wanted to add some extra zing to it, so I would consider adding 1/4 cup chutney, thinly sliced stuffed green olives, or thinly sliced green onions -- but wouldn't it be even better to prepare this cheese ball as it is and surround it with a relish tray with each of the additions as an optional garnish for your guests!",2008-04-12

Decadent and delicious.  Except for using my whisk and some ""elbow grease"" rather than a mixer of any sort, I made it exactly as directed, with walnuts, and the only thing I'd even consider changing would be to toast the walnuts in advance, maybe even use a mix of nuts, and sprinkle some on top.

I therefore had to use cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery.  I added a stalk of celery in addition.  I plan to try this recipe with the cream of celery next time.  
I would probably add salt to the veggies next time as they didn‚Äôt have much flavor and I had to add a lot when it came time to season to taste.  I had to add celery salt, onion salt and garlic powder to get it right.  
I thought I had bread but only had one slice (figures!) so I made crumbs with that then I used a flour/corn flake misture that I had premixed for breading chicken.  I added that to the bread crumbs along with a few pats of butter.  
All in all I liked this dish and will make it again.  I think it could also be altered to include some other spices (Italian seasonings, for example) and would be just as good.

I&#039;m not a huge fan of cumin, so I cut that in half and added a little dry mustard. I think next time I might add a bit more ketchup. They were really good served on a bun with some kraut, just what I was craving. The texture might take some getting used to, but they were fine with the kraut.

We don't have Rotel Tomatoes in Canada, so I used a can of Spicy Red Pepper tomatoes instead, and also added two chopped jalapenos.  Instead of using vinegar, I used the juice of two limes, and then tossed in a good handful of finely chopped cilantro.

363237,67728,5,1,"I'm with ya, Boomette -- love the orzo! I had two pounds of shrimp, so I doubled the recipe. Really flavorful, and so vibrant in color. My only complaint was that I shouldn't have added the extra turmeric because it gave the dish a bit of a bitter undertone, but that was my own fault (I was looking at the extra spoonful and thinking I shouldn't add that much turmeric, but then I just tossed it in anyway). Other than that, this recipe was perfect for us. I'm sure I'll be making this one again, thanks for posting! Made for The Honeys for ZWT8",2012-07-31

138131,171683,5,1,"Yum, these were great!  I knew I was serving perogies, and I wanted to have pork with them, so I searched for &quot;Polish Pork Chops&quot; and this recipe came up.  It&#039;s very simple, and the flavors are subtle, but really enhance the pork.  I used boneless center cut pork chops.  They were kinda thick (1/2&quot;), so I pounded them down to about 1/4&quot;.  I had six chops, so instead of measuring out the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and marjoram, I just sprinkled the chops on both sides with them.  I needed 2 eggs for the 6 chops.  I found that the chops plumped up again once they started cooking, so it took a bit longer to make sure they were not going to be raw in the middle.  If I did it again, I&#039;d probably pound them thinner.  All in all, a very tasty and easy week night supper.",2014-02-28

278835,704950,4,1,"These are really good!  When they came out of the oven, I expected them to be more dense with the mascarpone cheese in there but they were really light and airy.
I used walnuts as my nuts and Guirardelli 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate chips for my melting.
The only problem I had was with the amount of powdered sugar to use in the icing.  I understood 1-2 cup to mean one to two cups but I think that Sassy in da South meant 1/2 cup because 1 cup is way too sweet for the icing. This was my first homemade icing so I will know better next time.
These brownies are so rich that it was o.k. without icing, I just left that in the bowl for on the side.  I had lots of fun melting in a double boiler too.  This is a great Saturday afternoon brownie project!  Great to practice cooking skills on.",2008-02-09
