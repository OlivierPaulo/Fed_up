why metal? it conducts heat better than glass or ceramic. why foil?  high heat can cook too well. loosely covering the top of the turkey will keep it from burning. why liquid? to catch the juices and fat as they drip from the turkey so that they will not burn from the high heat of the oven and stick on the bottom of the pan. you will be able to use this liquid as a base for your gravy. 5 rules for hht:
1) don't salt!!!!!!!! why suck the moisture out?

2)don't let the bird touch the pan! we want to roast, not stew.  when it sits on the bottom of the pan, instead of a rack, or it is squeezed into a too small pan, the hot air is unable to envelop the turkey, causing it to cook in it's own juices

3)don't baste the bird! it will break caramelization, slow down cooking and use up the pan juices

4) don't poke with a fork to turn or check the bird! piercing the meat will allow the flavorful meat juices to escape

5) don't cover the bird with cheesecloth! we don't care what martha says, covering the bird with cheesecloth will prevent browning. it will make a mighty tasting cheesecloth, though, if you are into that kinda thing!

when we lived in sydney we were frequent visitors to bill granger's restaurants where this dish was one of the stars. in london i've been slowly perfecting it, doing my very best to faithfully recreate each element. i used the corn fritters with avocado salsa recipe in bills open kitchen as the base. however in his restaurant bill also serves his corn fritters / avocado salsa with crispy grilled bacon, oven roasted tomatoes and fresh spinach. these elements really make the dish complete for me (but of course this a fantastic vegetarian dish sans bacon).

so here is my homage to bill granger and his wonderful corn fritters... with crispy bacon, oven roasted tomatoes, baby spinach and spicy avocado salsa.

have the deli counter cut the slices of turkey extra thick; cut the slices into thick strips to serve. 
mix together tender green or red leaf lettuce with shredded red cabbage for flavor and textural contrast. 
tart dried cherries or cranberries add sharpness to balance the sweet-tasting turkey and a chewy texture to contrast the tender greens, crisp apples, and crunchy nuts. 
toast the almonds in a skillet over medium heat to intensify their flavor.

the cheese we use is probably difficult or impossible to come by outside the netherlands. we use ""belegen"" or ""extra belegen"" gouda cheese. if you can get your hands on gouda cheese go for the medium aged one (not the mild/young or old varieties). by the way, feel free to experiment with different kinds of cheese but do take one with a strong flavor, one that melds nicely and is rather salty (so called ""american cheese"" is wrong if you'd ask me).

(don’t burn) you just want the meat good and wet with the sauce and enough to simmer but not so much it is soupy. it should be very meaty. on the flip side if you choose a real thick sauce you may need to add a little water to thin it out. you’re looking for the same consistency as a traditional marinara sauce to spread easily and be soaked up by the lasagna.","barbecue lasagna time-to-make, course, main-ingredient, preparation, main-dish, pasta, pork, lasagna, meat, pasta-rice-and-grains, 4-hours-or-less shredded pork with barbecue sauce, lasagna noodles, ricotta cheese, egg, salt, black pepper, pre-shredded mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese",2009-03-01

pastas served with this dish are typically smaller shapes, such as penne, farfalle, rigatoni and fusilli. if using longer types of pasta, such as spaghetti or fettuccine, the vegetables are normally sliced in thin strips to match the shape of the noodles.","dairy free chicken pasta primavera  gluten free lactose, weeknight, 60-minutes-or-less, time-to-make, course, main-ingredient, cuisine, preparation, occasion, north-american, main-dish, pasta, american, european, italian, dietary, one-dish-meal, gluten-free, comfort-food, northeastern-united-states, free-of-something, pasta-rice-and-grains, elbow-macaroni, penne, taste-mood, dairy-free oil, rice flour, pasta, olive oil mayonnaise, chicken stock, sea salt, fresh ground black pepper, frozen baby peas, mixed mushrooms, organic carrots, chicken breasts, sweet paprika",2009-09-28
